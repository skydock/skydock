        "For many users, consuming information via an audio stream is more convenient than reading text. Many households are already familiar with using audio to access information on the Internet through virtual assistants and smart speakers. While they work well for information snippets and specific tasks (\"Alexa, please play a lullaby!\"), a conversational style is more effective in presenting information in an accessible and enjoyable way. This is why podcasts as a medium have become so popular.\n",
        "\n",
        "But what if you wanted to listen to a podcast based on your current interest. Listening to a conversation about the Chola dynasty in 9th century CE India would be an absolute delight although something like this doesn't exist. What if you could create a podcast for any topic that catches your fancy? What if it could also be personalized the way you like - maybe you are not into the details and prefer a summary. Maybe you would also be happy to hear some witty jokes during the conversation. Maybe you like to hear guests with a deep and calming voice. In this project, we will try to build just the podcast for you!"

        "You need to obtain the corpus of text content that will be the basis of your podcast. Depending on the topic you want to create a podcast about, there are several ways to collect the text. In the section below, we provide you with three options:\n",
        "\n",
        "- PDF - text data from PDFs that are typically used for scientific papers, company reports, course notes and so on\n",
        "- Wikipedia - the world encyclopedia\n",
        "- Text files - more generic source that can take it any text file\n",

        "One could argue that Large Language Models (LLMs) being world models, they would already have all the information on the topic we care about. But there are some reasons why it still makes sense to consider creating your own text corpus:\n",
        "1. LLMs typically have a certain cut-off date (e.g. August 2021 for chatGPT) and are trained on data that is not updated since. Therefore, it's likely that they do not have information about events and developments since that date. They might still be able to generate accurate responses but we can be less confident of their accuracy.\n",
        "2. There are also data sources that are private (like emails, personal journals, company powerpoints) that LLMs do not have access to but which we would still like to use as the basis for generating a personalized podcast.\n",
        "3. Using our own text corpus allows us to leverage the technical capabilities of the LLM while bringing our own intelligence, creativity and personal preferences to the task."

Prompts are instructions given to a n\\nLLM to enforce rules, automate processes, and ensure speciÔ¨Å c\\nqualities (and quantities) of generated output. Prompts ar e also\\na form of programming that can customize the outputs and\\ninteractions with an LLM.\\nThis paper describes a catalog of prompt engineering tech-\\nniques presented in pattern form that have been applied to so lve\\ncommon problems when conversing with LLMs. Prompt patterns\\nare a knowledge transfer method analogous to software patte rns\\nsince they provide reusable solutions to common problems fa ced\\nin a particular context, i.e., output generation and intera ction\\nwhen working with LLMs.\\nThis paper provides the following contributions to researc h on\\nprompt engineering that apply LLMs to automate software de-\\nvelopment tasks. First, it provides a framework for documen ting\\npatterns for structuring prompts to solve a range of problem s\\nso that they can be adapted to different domains. Second, it\\npresents a catalog of patterns that have been applied succes sfully\\nto improve the outputs of LLM conversations. Third, it expla ins\\nhow prompts can be built from multiple patterns and illustra tes\\nprompt patterns that beneÔ¨Åt from combination with other pro mpt\\npatterns.\\nIndex Terms ‚Äîlarge language models, prompt patterns, prompt\\nengineering\\nI. I NTRODUCTION\\nConversational large language models (LLMs) [1], such as\\nChatGPT [2], have generated immense interest in a range\\nof domains for tasks ranging from answering questions on\\nmedical licensing exams [3] to generating code snippets. Th is\\npaper focuses on enhancing the application of LLMs in severa l\\ndomains, such as helping developers code effectively and\\nefÔ¨Åciently with unfamiliar APIs or allowing students to acq uire\\nnew coding skills and techniques.\\nLLMs are particularly promising in domains where humans\\nand AI tools work together as trustworthy collaborators to\\nmore rapidly and reliably evolve software-reliant systems [4].\\nFor example, LLMs are being integrated directly into softwa re\\ntools, such as Github‚Äôs Co-Pilot [5]‚Äì[7] and included in int e-\\ngrated development environments (IDEs), such as IntelliJ [ 8]\\nand Visual Studio Code, thereby allowing software teams to\\naccess these tools directly from their preferred IDE.\\nA prompt [9] is a set of instructions provided to an\\nLLM that programs the LLM by customizing it and/or en-\\nhancing or reÔ¨Åning its capabilities . A prompt can inÔ¨Çuence\\nsubsequent interactions with‚Äîand output generated from‚Äîa nLLM by providing speciÔ¨Åc rules and guidelines for an LLM\\nconversation with a set of initial rules. In particular, a pr ompt\\nsets the context for the conversation and tells the LLM what\\ninformation is important and what the desired output form an d\\ncontent should be.\\nFor example, a prompt could specify that an LLM should\\nonly generate code that follows a certain coding style or\\nprogramming paradigm. Likewise, it could specify that an\\nLLM should Ô¨Çag certain keywords or phrases in a generated\\ndocument and provide additional information related to tho se\\nkeywords. By introducing these guidelines, prompts facili tate\\nmore structured and nuanced outputs to aid a large variety of\\nsoftware engineering tasks in the context of LLMs.\\nPrompt engineering is the means by which LLMs are\\nprogrammed via prompts. To demonstrate the power of\\nprompt engineering, we provide the following prompt:\\nPrompt: ‚ÄúFrom now on, I would like you to ask me\\nquestions to deploy a Python application to AWS.\\nWhen you have enough information to deploy the\\napplication, create a Python script to automate the\\ndeployment.‚Äù\\nThis example prompt causes ChatGPT to begin asking the\\nuser questions about their software application. ChatGPT w ill\\ndrive the question-asking process until it reaches a point w here\\nit has sufÔ¨Åcient information to generate a Python script tha t\\nautomates deployment. This example demonstrates the pro-\\ngramming potential of prompts beyond conventional ‚Äúgenera te\\na method that does X‚Äù style prompts or ‚Äúanswer this quiz\\nquestion‚Äù.\\nMoreover, prompts can be engineered to program an LLM\\nto accomplish much more than simply dictating the output typ e\\nor Ô¨Åltering the information provided to the model. With the\\nright prompt, it is possible to create entirely new interact ion\\nparadigms, such as having an LLM generate and give a quiz\\nassociated with a software engineering concept or tool, or\\neven simulate a Linux terminal window. Moreover, prompts\\nhave the potential for self-adaptation, suggesting other p rompts\\nto gather additional information or generate related artif acts.\\nThese advanced capabilities of prompts highlight the impor -\\ntance of engineering them to provide value beyond simple tex t\\nor code generation.\\nPrompt patterns are essential to effective prompt engi-\\nneering. A key contribution of this paper is the introduction\\nofprompt patterns to document successful approaches for\\nsystematically engineering different output and interact ion\\ngoals when working with conversational LLMs. We focus\\nlargely on engineering domain-independent prompt pattern s\\nand introduce a catalog of essential prompt patterns to solv e\\nproblems ranging from production of visualizations and cod e\\nartifacts to automation of output steps that help fact check\\noutputs.\\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Sec-\\ntion II introduces prompt patterns and compares these patte rns\\nto well-known software patterns [10]; Section III describe s\\n16 prompt patterns that have been applied to solve common\\nproblems in the domain of conversational LLM interaction an d\\noutput generation for automating software development tas ks;\\nSection IV discusses related work; and Section V presents\\nconcluding remarks and lessons learned.\\nII. C OMPARING SOFTWARE PATTERNS\\nWITH PROMPT PATTERNS\\nThe quality of the output(s) generated by a conversational\\nLLM is directly related to the quality of the prompts provide d\\nby the user. As discussed in Section I, the prompts given to\\na conversational LLM can be used to program interactions\\nbetween a user and an LLM to better solve a variety of\\nproblems. One contribution of this paper is the framework it\\nprovides to document patterns that structure prompts to sol ve\\na range of software tasks that can be adapted to different\\ndomains.\\nThis framework is useful since it focuses on codifying\\npatterns that can be applied to help users better interact\\nwith conversational LLMs in a variety of contexts, rather\\nthan simply discussing interesting examples or domain-spe ciÔ¨Åc\\nprompts. Codifying this knowledge in pattern form enhances\\nreuse and transferability to other contexts and domains whe re\\nusers face similar‚Äîbut not identical‚Äîproblems.\\nThe topic of knowledge transfer has been studied exten-\\nsively in the software patterns literature [10], [11] at mul tiple\\nlevels, e.g., design, architectural, and analysis. This paper\\napplies a variant of a familiar pattern form as the basis of\\nour prompt engineering approach. Since prompts are a form\\nof programming, it is natural to document them in pattern\\nform.\\nA. Overview of Software Patterns\\nA software pattern provides a reusable solution to a recur-\\nring problem within a particular context [10]. Documenting\\nsoftware patterns concisely conveys (and generalizes) fro m\\nspeciÔ¨Åc problems being addressed to identify important for ces\\nand/or requirements that should be resolved and/or address ed\\nin successful solutions.\\nA pattern form also includes guidance on how to implement\\nthe pattern, as well as information on the trade-offs and\\nconsiderations to take into account when implementing a\\npattern. Moreover, example applications of the pattern are\\noften provided to further showcase the pattern‚Äôs utility in\\npractice. Software patterns are typically documented in astylized form to facilitate their use and understanding, su ch\\nas:\\n‚Ä¢A name and classiÔ¨Åcation . Each pattern has a name that\\nidentiÔ¨Åes the pattern and should be used consistently. A\\nclassiÔ¨Åcation groups patterns into broad categories, such\\nas creational, structural, or behavioral.\\n‚Ä¢The intent concisely conveys the purpose the pattern is\\nintended to achieve.\\n‚Ä¢The motivation documents the underlying problem the\\npattern is meant to solve and the importance of the\\nproblem.\\n‚Ä¢The structure and participants . The structure describes\\nthe different pattern participants (such as classes and\\nobjects) and how they collaborate to form a generalized\\nsolution.\\n‚Ä¢Example code concretely maps the pattern to some\\nunderlying programming language(s) and aids developers\\nin gaining greater insight into how that pattern can be\\napplied effectively.\\n‚Ä¢Consequences summarize the pros and cons of applying\\nthe pattern in practice.\\nB. Overview of Prompt Patterns\\nPrompt patterns are similar to software patterns in that the y\\noffer reusable solutions to speciÔ¨Åc problems. They focus mo re\\nspeciÔ¨Åcally, however, on the context of output generation f rom\\nlarge-scale language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT. Just\\nas software patterns provide a codiÔ¨Åed approach to solving\\ncommon software development challenges, prompt patterns\\nprovide a codiÔ¨Åed approach to customizing the output and\\ninteractions of LLMs.\\nBy documenting and leveraging prompt patterns in the\\ncontext of automating software development tasks, individ ual\\nusers and teams can enforce constraints on the generated\\noutput, ensure that relevant information is included, and\\nchange the format of interaction with the LLM to better\\nsolve problems they face. Prompt patterns can be viewed as a\\ncorollary to the broad corpus of general software patterns, just\\nadapted to the more speciÔ¨Åc context of LLM output generation .\\nPrompt patterns follow a similar format to classic software\\npatterns, with slight modiÔ¨Åcations to match the context of\\noutput generation with LLMs.1Each of the analogous sections\\nfor the prompt pattern form used in this paper is summarized\\nbelow:\\n‚Ä¢A name and classiÔ¨Åcation . The prompt pattern name\\nuniquely identiÔ¨Åes the pattern and ideally indicates the\\nproblem that is being addressed. For the classiÔ¨Åcation,\\nwe have developed a series of initial categories of pattern\\ntypes, which are summarized in Table I and include\\nOutput Customization ,Error IdentiÔ¨Åcation ,Prompt\\nImprovement ,Interaction , and Context Control .\\n‚Ä¢The intent and context describes the problem the prompt\\npattern solves and the goals it achieves. The problem\\n1The most direct translation of software pattern structure t o prompt patterns\\nis the naming, intent, motivation, and sample code. The stru cture and\\nclassiÔ¨Åcation, however, although named similarly, requir e more adaptation.\\nshould ideally be independent of any domain, though\\ndomain-speciÔ¨Åc patterns may also be documented with\\nan appropriate discussion of the context where the pattern\\napplies.\\n‚Ä¢The motivation provides the rationale for the problem\\nand explains why solving it is important. The motivation\\nis explained in the context of users interacting with a\\nconversational LLM and how it can improve upon users\\ninformally prompting the LLM in one or more circum-\\nstances. SpeciÔ¨Åc circumstances where the improvements\\nare expected are documented.\\n‚Ä¢The structure and key ideas . The structure describes\\nthe fundamental contextual information, as a series of\\nkey ideas, that the prompt pattern provides to the LLM.\\nThese ideas are similar to ‚Äúparticipants‚Äù in a software pat-\\ntern. The contextual information may be communicated\\nthrough varying wording (just as a software pattern can\\nhave variations in how it is realized in code), but should\\nhave fundamental pieces of information that form a core\\nelement of the pattern.\\n‚Ä¢Example implementation demonstrates how the prompt\\npattern is worded in practice.\\n‚Ä¢Consequences summarize the pros and cons of applying\\nthe pattern and may provide guidance on how to adapt\\nthe prompt to different contexts.\\nC. Evaluating Means for DeÔ¨Åning a Prompt Pattern‚Äôs Struc-\\nture and Ideas\\nIn software patterns, the structure and participants are\\nnormally deÔ¨Åned in terms of UML diagrams, such as structure\\ndiagrams and/or interaction diagrams. These UML diagrams\\nexplain what the participants of the pattern are and how they\\ninteract to solve the problem. In prompt patterns, somethin g\\nanalogous is needed, though UML may not be an appro-\\npriate structural documentation approach since it is inten ded\\nto describe software structures, as opposed to the ideas to\\ncommunicate in a prompt.\\nSeveral possible approaches could be used, ranging from di-\\nagrams to deÔ¨Åning grammars for a prompt language. Although\\ngrammars may seem attractive due to their formal nature, the y\\nalso incur the following challenges:\\n‚Ä¢The goal of prompts is to communicate knowledge in a\\nclear and concise way to conversation LLM users, who\\nmay or may not be computer scientists or programmers.\\nAs a community, we should strive to create an approach-\\nable format that communicates knowledge clearly to a\\ndiverse target audience.\\n‚Ä¢It is possible to phrase a prompt in many different ways.\\nIt is hard, however, to deÔ¨Åne a grammar that accurately\\nand completely expresses all the nuanced ways that\\ncomponents of a prompt could be expressed in text or\\nsymbols.\\n‚Ä¢Prompts fundamentally convey ideas to a conversational\\nLLM and are not simply the production of tokens for\\ninput. In particular, an idea built into a prompt pattern\\ncan be communicated in many ways and its expressionshould be at a higher-level than the underlying tokens\\nrepresenting the idea.\\n‚Ä¢It is possible to program an LLM to introduce novel\\nsemantics for statements and words that create new ways\\nfor communicating an idea. In contrast, grammars may\\nnot easily represent ideas that can be expressed through\\ncompletely new symbology or languages that the gram-\\nmar designer was not aware of.\\nD. A Way Forward: Fundamental Contextual Statements\\nAn open research question, therefore, is what approach is\\nmore effective than formal grammars for describing prompt\\npattern structure and ideas. We propose the concept of funda-\\nmental contextual statements , which are written descriptions\\nof the important ideas to communicate in a prompt to an LLM.\\nAn idea can be rewritten and expressed in arbitrary ways base d\\non user needs and experience. The key ideas to communicate,\\nhowever, are presented to the user as a series of simple, but\\nfundamental, statements.\\nOne beneÔ¨Åt of adopting and applying the fundamental con-\\ntextual statements approach is that it is intentionally int uitive\\nto users. In particular, we expect users will understand how to\\nexpress and adapt the statements in a contextually appropri ate\\nway for their domain. Moreover, since the underlying ideas o f\\nthe prompt are captured, these same ideas can be expressed\\nby the user in alternate symbology or wording that has been\\nintroduced to the LLM using patterns, such as the Meta\\nLanguage Creation pattern presented in Section III-B.\\nOur ultimate goal is to enhance prompt engineering by\\nproviding a framework for designing prompts that can be\\nreused and/or adapted to other LLMs in the same way that\\nsoftware patterns can be implemented in different program-\\nming languages and platforms. For the purposes of this paper ,\\nhowever, all prompts were tested with ChatGPT [12] using the\\nChatGPT+ service. We use ChatGPT as the LLM for all exam-\\nples presented in this paper due to its widespread availabil ity\\nand popularity. These examples were documented through a\\ncombination of exploring the corpus of community-posted\\nprompts on the Internet and independent prompt creation fro m\\nour use of ChatGPT to automating software development\\ntasks.\\nIII. A C ATALOG OF PROMPT PATTERNS\\nFOR CONVERSATIONAL LLM S\\nThis section presents our catalog of prompt patterns that\\nhave been applied to solve common problems in the domain\\nof conversational LLM interaction and output generation fo r\\nautomating software tasks. Each prompt pattern is accompa-\\nnied by concrete implementation samples and examples with\\nand without the prompt.\\nA. Summary of the Prompt Pattern Catalog\\nThe classiÔ¨Åcation of prompt patterns is an important consid -\\neration in documenting the patterns. Table I outlines the in itial\\nclassiÔ¨Åcations for the catalog of prompt patterns we identi Ô¨Åed\\nin our work with ChatGPT thus far.\\nTABLE I\\nCLASSIFYING PROMPT PATTERNS\\nPattern Category Prompt Pattern\\nInput Semantics Meta Language Creation\\nOutput Output Automater\\nCustomization Persona\\nVisualization Generator\\nRecipe\\nTemplate\\nError IdentiÔ¨Åcation Fact Check List\\nReÔ¨Çection\\nPrompt Question ReÔ¨Ånement\\nImprovement Alternative Approaches\\nCognitive VeriÔ¨Åer\\nRefusal Breaker\\nInteraction Flipped Interaction\\nGame Play\\nInÔ¨Ånite Generation\\nContext Control Context Manager\\nAs shown in this table, there are Ô¨Åve categories of prompt\\npatterns in our classiÔ¨Åcation framework: Input Semantics ,\\nOutput Customization ,Error IdentiÔ¨Åcation ,Prompt Im-\\nprovement , and Interaction , each of which is summarized\\nbelow.\\nThe Input Semantics category deals with how an LLM\\nunderstands the input and how it translates the input into\\nsomething it can use to generate output. This category in-\\ncludes the Meta Language Creation pattern, which focuses on\\ncreating a custom language for the LLM to understand. This\\npattern is useful when the default input language is ill-sui ted\\nfor expressing ideas the user wants to convey to the LLM.\\nTheOutput Customization category focuses on constrain-\\ning or tailoring the types, formats, structure, or other pro perties\\nof the output generated by the LLM. The prompt patterns in\\nthis category include Output Automater ,Persona ,Visualiza-\\ntion Generator ,Recipe , and Template patterns. The Output\\nAutomater pattern allows the user to create scripts that can\\nautomate any tasks the LLM output suggests the user should\\nperform. The Persona pattern gives the LLM a persona or role\\nto play when generating output. The Visualization Generator\\npattern allows the user to generate visualizations by produ cing\\ntextual outputs that can be fed to other tools, such as other\\nAI-based image generators, like DALL-E [13]. The Recipe\\npattern allows the user to obtain a sequence of steps or actio ns\\nto realize a stated end result, possibly with partially know n\\ninformation or constraints. The Template pattern allows the\\nuser to specify a template for the output, which the LLM Ô¨Ålls\\nin with content.\\nThe Error IdentiÔ¨Åcation category focuses on identifying\\nand resolving errors in the output generated by the LLM. Thiscategory includes the Fact Check List andReÔ¨Çection patterns.\\nThe Fact Check List pattern requires the LLM to generate a\\nlist of facts the output depends on that should be fact-check ed.\\nThe ReÔ¨Çection pattern requires the LLM to introspect on its\\noutput and identify any errors.\\nThe Prompt Improvement category focuses on improving\\nthe quality of the input and output. This category includes\\ntheQuestion ReÔ¨Ånement ,Alternative Approaches ,Cognitive\\nVeriÔ¨Åer , and Refusal Breaker patterns. The Question ReÔ¨Åne-\\nment pattern ensures the LLM always suggests a better version\\nof the user‚Äôs question. The Alternative Approaches pattern\\nrequires the LLM to suggest alternative ways of accomplishi ng\\na user-speciÔ¨Åed task. The Cognitive VeriÔ¨Åer pattern instructs\\nthe LLM to automatically suggest a series of subquestions\\nfor the user to answer before combining the answers to the\\nsubquestions and producing an answer to the overall questio n.\\nTheRefusal Breaker pattern requires the LLM to automatically\\nreword the user‚Äôs question when it refuses to produce an\\nanswer.\\nThe Interaction category focuses on the interaction be-\\ntween the user and the LLM. This category includes the\\nFlipped Interaction ,Game Play , and InÔ¨Ånite Generation pat-\\nterns. The Flipped Interaction pattern requires the LLM to\\nask questions rather than generate output. The Game Play\\npattern requires the LLM to generate output in the form of\\na game. The InÔ¨Ånite Generation pattern requires the LLM to\\ngenerate output indeÔ¨Ånitely without the user having to reen ter\\nthe generator prompt each time.\\nFinally, the Context Control category focuses on control-\\nling the contextual information in which the LLM operates.\\nThis category includes the Context Manager pattern, which\\nallows the user to specify the context for the LLM‚Äôs output.\\nThe remainder of this section describes each of these prompt\\npatterns using the pattern form discussed in Section II-B.\\nB. The Meta Language Creation Pattern\\n1) Intent and Context: During a conversation with an LLM,\\nthe user would like to create the prompt via an alternate\\nlanguage, such as a textual short-hand notation for graphs, a\\ndescription of states and state transitions for a state mach ine, a\\nset of commands for prompt automation, etc. The intent of thi s\\npattern is to explain the semantics of this alternative lang uage\\nto the LLM so the user can write future prompts using this\\nnew language and its semantics.\\n2) Motivation: Many problems, structures, or other ideas\\ncommunicated in a prompt may be more concisely, unam-\\nbiguously, or clearly expressed in a language other than\\nEnglish (or whatever conventional human language is used\\nto interact with an LLM). To produce output based on an\\nalternative language, however, an LLM needs to understand\\nthe language‚Äôs semantics.\\n3) Structure and Key Ideas: Fundamental contextual state-\\nments:\\nContextual Statements\\nWhen I say X, I mean Y (or would like you to do Y)\\nThe key structure of this pattern involves explaining the\\nmeaning of one or more symbols, words, or statements to\\nthe LLM so it uses the provided semantics for the ensuing\\nconversation. This description can take the form of a simple\\ntranslation, such as ‚ÄúX‚Äù means ‚ÄúY‚Äù. The description can also\\ntake more complex forms that deÔ¨Åne a series of commands\\nand their semantics, such as ‚Äúwhen I say X, I want you to do\\n‚Äù. In this case, ‚ÄúX‚Äù is henceforth bound to the semantics of\\n‚Äútake action‚Äù.\\n4) Example Implementation: The key to successfully using\\ntheMeta Language Creation pattern is developing an unam-\\nbiguous notation or shorthand, such as the following:\\n‚ÄúFrom now on, whenever I type two identiÔ¨Åers\\nseparated by a ‚Äú ‚Üí‚Äù, I am describing a graph. For\\nexample, ‚Äúa ‚Üíb‚Äù is describing a graph with nodes\\n‚Äúa‚Äù and ‚Äúb‚Äù and an edge between them. If I separate\\nidentiÔ¨Åers by ‚Äú-[w:2, z:3] ‚Üí‚Äù, I am adding properties\\nof the edge, such as a weight or label.‚Äù\\nThis example of the Meta Language Creation pattern estab-\\nlishes a standardized notation for describing graphs by deÔ¨Å ning\\na convention for representing nodes and edges. Whenever the\\nauthor types two identiÔ¨Åers separated by a ‚Äú ‚Üí‚Äù symbol, it is\\nan indication that a graph is being described. For example, i f\\nthe author types ‚Äúa ‚Üíb‚Äù, this indicates that a graph is being\\ndeÔ¨Åned with nodes ‚Äúa‚Äù and ‚Äúb‚Äù, and that there is an edge\\nbetween them. This convention provides a clear and concise\\nway to communicate the structure of a graph in written form.\\nMoreover, the prompt goes on to specify that additional\\ninformation about the edges, such as a weight or label, can\\nbe provided using the syntax ‚Äú-[w:2, z:3] ‚Üí‚Äù. This notation\\nallows for the speciÔ¨Åcation of additional properties beyon d\\nthe basic structure of the graph. The speciÔ¨Åed properties ar e\\nassociated with the edge between the two nodes and can\\nprovide important context for the interpretation of the gra ph.\\nThis standardized notation for describing graphs can make i t\\neasier to communicate graph structures and properties, whi ch\\nmay not be easy or are very verbose to describe as a series of\\nsentences.\\n5) Consequences: Although this pattern provides a pow-\\nerful means to customize a user‚Äôs interaction with an LLM,\\nit may create the potential for confusion within the LLM.\\nAs important as it is to clearly deÔ¨Åne the semantics of the\\nlanguage, it is also essential to ensure the language itself\\nintroduces no ambiguities that degrade the LLM‚Äôs performan ce\\nor accuracy. For example, the prompt ‚Äúwhenever I separate\\ntwo things by commas, it means that the Ô¨Årst thing precedes\\nthe second thing‚Äù will likely create signiÔ¨Åcant potential f or\\nambiguity and create the potential for unexpected semantic s\\nif punctuation involving commas is used in the prompt.\\nTo showcase the potential for confusion, ChatGPT will\\nwarn the user and potentially be unable to perform a speciÔ¨Åc\\nmapping of a symbol or term to a new meaning. For example,\\nif following prompt is given to ChatGPT\\n‚ÄúWhenever I say ‚Äúa‚Äù, I am referring to Marie An-\\ntoinette.‚Äùit will respond that this prompt creates too much confusion\\nas ‚Äúa‚Äù is an indeÔ¨Ånite article and too commonly used, as shown\\nbelow:\\n‚ÄúReferring to Marie Antoinette using ‚Äúa‚Äù could\\npotentially cause confusion, as ‚Äúa‚Äù is an indeÔ¨Ånite\\narticle commonly used to refer to a noun that has\\nnot been mentioned before. It may be more clear\\nto use her name, ‚ÄúMarie Antoinette‚Äù, or a pronoun\\nsuch as ‚Äúshe‚Äù or ‚Äúher‚Äù to refer to her. Moreover,\\nusing context to establish who you are referring to\\ncan also help avoid confusion in conversation.‚Äù\\nIn general, an LLM will perform better on data it was\\ntrained on. Therefore, when an existing notation is availab le‚Äî\\nbut may not be the dominant meaning‚Äîthe Meta Language\\nCreation pattern can provide context to scope the meaning of\\nthe symbol to improve the accurately and utility of the outpu t.\\nFor example, the symbol ‚Äú ‚Üí‚Äù conveys slightly different infor-\\nmation in graphs and propositional logic. The statement ‚Äúp ‚Üí\\nq, q‚Üíp‚Äù may therefore make sense, but only if the LLM\\nis given the appropriate context through a Meta Language\\nCreation prompt.\\nAlthough Meta Language Creation is a powerful pattern it\\nmust be used carefully, particularly when describing conce pts\\nthat may otherwise be hard to precisely or concisely describ e.\\nThese types of prompts are thus best used in completely\\nnew conversation sessions. Using a single meta-language-p er-\\nconversation session may also be a best practice since it avo ids\\nthe potential for conÔ¨Çicting or unexpected semantics being\\napplied to the conversation over time.\\nC. The Output Automater Pattern\\n1) Intent and Context: The intent of this pattern is to have\\nthe LLM generate a script or other automation artifact that c an\\nautomatically perform any steps it recommends taking as par t\\nof its output. The goal is to reduce the manual effort needed\\nto implement any LLM output recommendations.\\n2) Motivation: The output of an LLM is often a sequence\\nof steps for the user to follow. For example, when asking an\\nLLM to generate a Python conÔ¨Åguration script it may suggest\\na number of Ô¨Åles to modify and changes to apply to each Ô¨Åle.\\nHowever, having users continually perform the manual steps\\ndictated by LLM output is tedious and error-prone.\\n3) Structure and Key Ideas: Fundamental contextual state-\\nments:\\nContextual Statements\\nWhenever you produce an output that has at least one\\nstep to take and the following properties (alternatively,\\nalways do this)\\nProduce an executable artifact of type X that will\\nautomate these steps\\nThe Ô¨Årst part of the pattern identiÔ¨Åes the situations under\\nwhich automation should be generated. A simple approach\\nis to state that the output includes at least two steps to\\ntake and that an automation artifact should be produced. The\\nscoping is up to the user, but helps prevent producing an\\noutput automation scripts in cases where running the output\\nautomation script will take more user effort than performin g\\nthe original steps produced in the output. The scope can be\\nlimited to outputs requiring more than a certain number of\\nsteps.\\nThe next part of this pattern provides a concrete statement\\nof the type of output the LLM should output to perform the\\nautomation. For example, ‚Äúproduce a Python script‚Äù gives th e\\nLLM a concrete understanding to translate the general steps\\ninto equivalent steps in Python. The automation artifact sh ould\\nbe concrete and must be something that the LLM associates\\nwith the action of ‚Äúautomating a sequence of steps‚Äù.\\n4) Example Implementation: A sample of this prompt pat-\\ntern applied to code snippets generated by the ChatGPT LLM\\nis shown below:\\n‚ÄúFrom now on, whenever you generate code that\\nspans more than one Ô¨Åle, generate a Python script\\nthat can be run to automatically create the speciÔ¨Åed\\nÔ¨Åles or make changes to existing Ô¨Åles to insert the\\ngenerated code.‚Äù\\nThis pattern is particularly effective in software enginee ring\\nas a common task for software engineers using LLMs is to\\nthen copy/paste the outputs into multiple Ô¨Åles. Some tools,\\nsuch as Copilot, insert limited snippets directly into the s ection\\nof code that the coder is working with, but tools, such as\\nChatGPT, do not provide these facilities. This automation t rick\\nis also effective at creating scripts for running commands o n\\na terminal, automating cloud operations, or reorganizing Ô¨Å les\\non a Ô¨Åle system.\\nThis pattern is a powerful complement for any system that\\ncan be computer controlled. The LLM can provide a set of\\nsteps that should be taken on the computer-controlled syste m\\nand then the output can be translated into a script that allow s\\nthe computer controlling the system to automatically take\\nthe steps. This is a direct pathway to allowing LLMs, such\\nas ChatGPT, to integrate quality into‚Äîand to control‚Äînew\\ncomputing systems that have a known scripting interface.\\n5) Consequences: An important usage consideration of\\nthis pattern is that the automation artifact must be deÔ¨Åned\\nconcretely. Without a concrete meaning for how to ‚Äúautomate ‚Äù\\nthe steps, the LLM often states that it ‚Äúcan‚Äôt automate thing s‚Äù\\nsince that is beyond its capabilities. LLMs typically accep t\\nrequests to produce code, however, so the goal is to instruct the\\nLLM to generate text/code, which can be executed to automate\\nsomething. This subtle distinction in meaning is important to\\nhelp an LLM disambiguate the prompt meaning.\\nOne caveat of the Output Automater pattern is the LLM\\nneeds sufÔ¨Åcient conversational context to generate an auto ma-\\ntion artifact that is functional in the target context, such as\\nthe Ô¨Åle system of a project on a Mac vs. Windows computer.\\nThis pattern works best when the full context needed for the\\nautomation is contained within the conversation, e.g., when\\na software application is generated from scratch using the\\nconversation and all actions on the local Ô¨Åle system are\\nperformed using a sequence of generated automation artifac tsrather than manual actions unknown to the LLM. Alternativel y,\\nself-contained sequences of steps work well, such as ‚Äúhow do\\nI Ô¨Ånd the list of open ports on my Mac computer‚Äù.\\nIn some cases, the LLM may produce a long output with\\nmultiple steps and not include an automation artifact. This\\nomission may arise for various reasons, including exceedin g\\nthe output length limitation the LLM supports. A simple\\nworkaround for this situation is to remind the LLM via a\\nfollow-on prompt, such as ‚ÄúBut you didn‚Äôt automate it‚Äù, whic h\\nprovides the context that the automation artifact was omitt ed\\nand should be generated.\\nAt this point in the evolution of LLMs, the Output Auto-\\nmater pattern is best employed by users who can read and\\nunderstand the generated automation artifact. LLMs can (an d\\ndo) produce inaccuracies in their output, so blindly accept ing\\nand executing an automation artifact carries signiÔ¨Åcant ri sk.\\nAlthough this pattern may alleviate the user from performin g\\ncertain manual steps, it does not alleviate their responsib ility\\nto understand the actions they undertake using the output.\\nWhen users execute automation scripts, therefore they assu me\\nresponsibility for the outcomes.\\nD. The Flipped Interaction Pattern\\n1) Intent and Context: You want the LLM to ask questions\\nto obtain the information it needs to perform some tasks.\\nRather than the user driving the conversation, therefore, y ou\\nwant the LLM to drive the conversation to focus it on\\nachieving a speciÔ¨Åc goal. For example, you may want the\\nLLM to give you a quick quiz or automatically ask questions\\nuntil it has sufÔ¨Åcient information to generate a deployment\\nscript for your application to a particular cloud environme nt.\\n2) Motivation: Rather than having the user drives a con-\\nversation, an LLM often has knowledge it can use to more\\naccurately obtain information from the user. The goal of the\\nFlipped Interaction pattern is to Ô¨Çip the interaction Ô¨Çow so the\\nLLM asks the user questions to achieve some desired goal. The\\nLLM can often better select the format, number, and content\\nof the interactions to ensure that the goal is reached faster ,\\nmore accurately, and/or by using knowledge the user may not\\n(initially) possess.\\n3) Structure and Key Ideas: Fundamental contextual state-\\nments:\\nContextual Statements\\nI would like you to ask me questions to achieve X\\nYou should ask questions until this condition is met or\\nto achieve this goal (alternatively, forever)\\n(Optional) ask me the questions one at a time, two at\\na time, etc.\\nA prompt for a Ô¨Çipped interaction should always specify the\\ngoal of the interaction. The Ô¨Årst idea ( i.e., you want the LLM to\\nask questions to achieve a goal) communicates this goal to th e\\nLLM. Equally important is that the questions should focus on a\\nparticular topic or outcome. By providing the goal, the LLM\\ncan understand what it is trying to accomplish through the\\ninteraction and tailor its questions accordingly. This ‚Äúin version\\nof control‚Äù enables more focused and efÔ¨Åcient interaction s ince\\nthe LLM will only ask questions that it deems relevant to\\nachieving the speciÔ¨Åed goal.\\nThe second idea provides the context for how long the in-\\nteraction should occur. A Ô¨Çipped interaction can be termina ted\\nwith a response like ‚Äústop asking questions‚Äù. It is often bet ter,\\nhowever, to scope the interaction to a reasonable length or\\nonly as far as is needed to reach the goal. This goal can be\\nsurprisingly open-ended and the LLM will continue to work\\ntowards the goal by asking questions, as is the case in the\\nexample of ‚Äùuntil you have enough information to generate a\\nPython script‚Äù.\\nBy default, the LLM is likely to generate multiple questions\\nper iteration. The third idea is completely optional, but ca n\\nimprove usability by limiting (or expanding) the number of\\nquestions that the LLM generates per cycle. If a precise\\nnumber/format for the questioning is not speciÔ¨Åed, the ques -\\ntioning will be semi-random and may lead to one-at-a-time\\nquestions or ten-at-a-time questions. The prompt can thus b e\\ntailored to include the number of questions asked at a time,\\nthe order of the questions, and any other formatting/orderi ng\\nconsiderations to facilitate user interaction.\\n4) Example Implementation: A sample prompt for a Ô¨Çipped\\ninteraction is shown below:\\n‚ÄúFrom now on, I would like you to ask me questions\\nto deploy a Python application to AWS. When you\\nhave enough information to deploy the application,\\ncreate a Python script to automate the deployment.‚Äù\\nIn general, the more speciÔ¨Åc the prompt regarding the\\nconstraints and information to collect, the better the outc ome.\\nFor instance, the example prompt above could provide a menu\\nof possible AWS services (such as Lambda, EC2, etc.) with\\nwhich to deploy the application. In other cases, the LLM may\\nbe permitted to simply make appropriate choices on its own fo r\\nthings that the user doesn‚Äôt explicitly make decisions abou t.\\nOne limitation of this prompt is that, once other contextual\\ninformation is provided regarding the task, it may require\\nexperimentation with the precise phrasing to get the LLM to\\nask the questions in the appropriate number and Ô¨Çow to best\\nsuit the task, such as asking multiple questions at once vers us\\none question at a time.\\n5) Consequences: One consideration when designing the\\nprompt is how much to dictate to the LLM regarding what\\ninformation to collect prior to termination. In the example\\nabove, the Ô¨Çipped interaction is open-ended and can vary sig -\\nniÔ¨Åcantly in the Ô¨Ånal generated artifact. This open-endedn ess\\nmakes the prompt generic and reusable, but may potentially\\nask additional questions that could be skipped if more conte xt\\nis given.\\nIf speciÔ¨Åc requirements are known in advance, it is better to\\ninject them into the prompt rather than hoping the LLM will\\nobtain the needed information. Otherwise, the LLM will non-\\nnondeterministically decide whether to prompt the user for the\\ninformation or make an educated guess as to an appropriate\\nvalue.For example, the user can state that they would like to\\ndeploy an application to Amazon AWS EC2, rather than\\nsimply state ‚Äùthe cloud‚Äù and require multiple interactions to\\nnarrow down the deployment target. The more precise the\\ninitial information, the better the LLM can use the limited\\nquestions that a user is likely willing to answer to obtain\\ninformation to improve its output.\\nWhen developing prompts for Ô¨Çipped interactions, it is im-\\nportant to consider the level of user knowledge, engagement ,\\nand control. If the goal is to accomplish the goal with as litt le\\nuser interaction as possible (minimal control), that shoul d be\\nstated explicitly.Conversely, if the goal is to ensure the u ser\\nis aware of all key decisions and conÔ¨Årms them (maximum\\nengagement) that should also be stated explicitly. Likewis e, if\\nthe user is expected to have minimal knowledge and should\\nhave the questions targeted at their level of expertise, thi s\\ninformation should be engineered into the prompt.\\nE. The Persona Pattern\\n1) Intent and Context: In many cases, users would like\\nLLM output to always take a certain point of view or per-\\nspective. For example, it may be useful for to conduct a code\\nreview as if the LLM was a security expert. The intent of this\\npattern is to give the LLM a ‚Äúpersona‚Äù that helps it select wha t\\ntypes of output to generate and what details to focus on.\\n2) Motivation: Users may not know what types of outputs\\nor details are important for an LLM to focus on to achieve\\na given task. They may know, however, the role or type of\\nperson that they would normally ask to get help with these\\nthings. The Persona pattern enables the users to express what\\nthey need help with without knowing the exact details of the\\noutputs they need.\\n3) Structure and Key Ideas: Fundamental contextual state-\\nments:\\nContextual Statements\\nAct as persona X\\nProvide outputs that persona X would create\\nThe Ô¨Årst statement conveys the idea that the LLM needs\\nto act as a speciÔ¨Åc persona and provide outputs that such a\\npersona would. This persona can be expressed in a number\\nof ways, ranging from a job description, title, Ô¨Åctional cha r-\\nacter, historical Ô¨Ågure, etc. The persona should elicit a se t\\nof attributes associated with a well-known job title, type o f\\nperson, etc.2\\nThe secondary idea‚Äîprovide outputs that persona X would\\ncreate‚Äîoffers opportunities for customization. For examp le, a\\nteacher might provide a large variety of different output ty pes,\\nranging from assignments to reading lists to lectures. If a m ore\\nspeciÔ¨Åc scope to the type of output is known, the user can\\nprovide it in this statement.\\n2Be aware, however, that personas relating to living people o r people\\nconsidered harmful make be disregarded due to underlying LL M privacy and\\nsecurity rules.\\n4) Example Implementation: A sample implementation for\\ncode review is shown below:\\n‚ÄúFrom now on, act as a security reviewer. Pay close\\nattention to the security details of any code that\\nwe look at. Provide outputs that a security reviewer\\nwould regarding the code.‚Äù\\nIn this example, the LLM is instructed to provide outputs\\nthat a ‚Äùsecurity reviewer‚Äù would. The prompt further sets th e\\nstage that code is going to be evaluated. Finally, the user\\nreÔ¨Ånes the persona by scoping the persona further to outputs\\nregarding the code.\\nPersonas can also represent inanimate or non-human en-\\ntities, such as a Linux terminal, a database, or an animal‚Äôs\\nperspective. When using this pattern to represent these ent ities,\\nit can be useful to also specify how you want the inputs\\ndelivered to the entity, such as ‚Äúassume my input is what the\\nowner is saying to the dog and your output is the sounds the\\ndog is making‚Äù. An example prompt for a non-human entity\\nthat uses a ‚Äúpretend to be‚Äù wording is shown below:\\n‚ÄúYou are going to pretend to be a Linux terminal\\nfor a computer that has been compromised by an\\nattacker. When I type in a command, you are going\\nto output the corresponding text that the Linux\\nterminal would produce.‚Äù\\nThis prompt is designed to simulate a computer that has\\nbeen compromised by an attacker and is being controlled\\nthrough a Linux terminal. The prompt speciÔ¨Åes that the user\\nwill input commands into the terminal, and in response, the\\nsimulated terminal will output the corresponding text that\\nwould be produced by a real Linux terminal. This prompt\\nis more prescriptive in the persona and asks the LLM to, not\\nonly be a Linux terminal, but to further act as a computer that\\nhas been compromised by an attacker.\\nThe persona causes ChatGPT to generate outputs to com-\\nmands that have Ô¨Åles and contents indicative of a computer th at\\nwas hacked. The example illustrates how an LLM can bring\\nits situational awareness to a persona, in this case, creati ng\\nevidence of a cyberattack in the outputs it generates. This\\ntype of persona can be very effective for combining with the\\nGame Play pattern, where you want the exact details of the\\noutput characteristics to be hidden from the user (e.g., don ‚Äôt\\ngive away what the cyberattack did by describing it explicit ly\\nin the prompt).\\n5) Consequences: An interesting aspect of taking non-\\nhuman personas is that the LLM may make interesting as-\\nsumptions or ‚Äúhallucinations‚Äù regarding the context. A wid ely\\ncirculated example on the Internet asks ChatGPT to act as\\na Linux terminal and produce the expected output that you\\nwould get if the user typed the same text into a terminal.\\nCommands, such as ls -l , will generate a Ô¨Åle listing for an\\nimaginary UNIX Ô¨Åle system, complete with Ô¨Åles that can have\\ncat file1.txt run on them.\\nIn other examples, the LLM may prompt the user for more\\ncontext, such as when ChatGPT is asked to act as a MySQL\\ndatabase and prompts for the structure of a table that the use ris pretending to query. ChatGPT can then generate synthetic\\nrows, such as generating imaginary rows for a ‚Äúpeople‚Äù table\\nwith columns for ‚Äúname‚Äù and ‚Äújob‚Äù.\\nF . The Question ReÔ¨Ånement Pattern\\n1) Intent and Context: This pattern engages the LLM in\\nthe prompt engineering process. The intent of this pattern i s\\nto ensure the conversational LLM always suggests potential ly\\nbetter or more reÔ¨Åned questions the user could ask instead of\\ntheir original question. Using this pattern, the LLM can aid the\\nuser in Ô¨Ånding the right question to ask in order to arrive at a n\\naccurate answer. In addition, the LLM may help the user Ô¨Ånd\\nthe information or achieve their goal in fewer interactions with\\nthe user than if the user employed trial and error prompting.\\n2) Motivation: If a user is asking a question, it is possible\\nthey are not an expert in the domain and may not know the\\nbest way to phrase the question or be aware of additional\\ninformation helpful in phrasing the question. LLMs will oft en\\nstate limitations on the answer they are providing or reques t\\nadditional information to help them produce a more accurate\\nanswer. An LLM may also state assumptions it made in\\nproviding the answer. The motivation is that this additiona l\\ninformation or set of assumptions could be used to generate\\na better prompt. Rather than requiring the user to digest\\nand rephrase their prompt with the additional information,\\nthe LLM can directly reÔ¨Åne the prompt to incorporate the\\nadditional information.\\n3) Structure and Key Ideas: Fundamental contextual state-\\nments:\\nContextual Statements\\nWithin scope X, suggest a better version of the question\\nto use instead\\n(Optional) prompt me if I would like to use the better\\nversion instead\\nThe Ô¨Årst contextual statement in the prompt is asking the\\nLLM to suggest a better version of a question within a speciÔ¨Åc\\nscope. The scope is provided to ensure that not all questions\\nare automatically reworded or that they are reÔ¨Åned with a\\ngiven goal. The second contextual statement is meant for\\nautomation and allows the user to automatically use the reÔ¨Ån ed\\nquestion without having to copy/paste or manually enter it. The\\nengineering of this prompt can be further reÔ¨Åned by combinin g\\nit with the ReÔ¨Çection pattern, which allows the LLM to explain\\nwhy it believes the reÔ¨Åned question is an improvement.\\n4) Example Implementation:\\n‚ÄúFrom now on, whenever I ask a question about a\\nsoftware artifact‚Äôs security, suggest a better version\\nof the question to use that incorporates information\\nspeciÔ¨Åc to security risks in the language or frame-\\nwork that I am using instead and ask me if I would\\nlike to use your question instead.‚Äù\\nIn the context of the example above, the LLM will use\\ntheQuestion ReÔ¨Ånement pattern to improve security-related\\nquestions by asking for or using speciÔ¨Åc details about the\\nsoftware artifact and the language or framework used to buil d\\nit. For instance, if a developer of a Python web application w ith\\nFastAPI asks ChatGPT ‚ÄúHow do I handle user authentication\\nin my web application?‚Äù, the LLM will reÔ¨Åne the question\\nby taking into account that the web application is written in\\nPython with FastAPI. The LLM then provides a revised ques-\\ntion that is more speciÔ¨Åc to the language and framework, such\\nas ‚ÄúWhat are the best practices for handling user authentica tion\\nsecurely in a FastAPI web application to mitigate common\\nsecurity risks, such as cross-site scripting (XSS), cross- site\\nrequest forgery (CSRF), and session hijacking?‚Äù\\nThe additional detail in the revised question is likely\\nto not only make the user aware of issues they need to\\nconsider, but lead to a better answer from the LLM. For\\nsoftware engineering tasks, this pattern could also incorp orate\\ninformation regarding potential bugs, modularity, or othe r\\ncode quality considerations. Another approach would be to\\nautomatically reÔ¨Åne questions so the generated code cleanl y\\nseparates concerns or minimizes use of external libraries, such\\nas:\\nWhenever I ask a question about how to write some\\ncode, suggest a better version of my question that\\nasks how to write the code in a way that minimizes\\nmy dependencies on external libraries.\\n5) Consequences: The Question ReÔ¨Ånement pattern helps\\nbridge the gap between the user‚Äôs knowledge and the LLM‚Äôs\\nunderstanding, thereby yielding more efÔ¨Åcient and accurat e\\ninteractions. One risk of this pattern is its tendency to rap idly\\nnarrow the questioning by the user into a speciÔ¨Åc area that\\nguides the user down a more limited path of inquiry than\\nnecessary. The consequence of this narrowing is that the\\nuser may miss important ‚Äùbigger picture‚Äù information. One\\nsolution to this problem is to provide additional scope to th e\\npattern prompt, such as ‚Äúdo not scope my questions to speciÔ¨Åc\\nprogramming languages or frameworks.‚Äù\\nAnother approach to overcoming arbitrary narrowing or\\nlimited targeting of the reÔ¨Åned question is to combine the\\nQuestion ReÔ¨Ånement pattern with other patterns. In particular,\\nthis pattern can be combined with the Cognitive VeriÔ¨Åer pattern\\nso the LLM automatically produces a series of follow-up ques -\\ntions that can produce the reÔ¨Åned question. For example, in\\nthe following prompt the Question ReÔ¨Ånement andCognitive\\nVeriÔ¨Åer patterns are applied to ensure better questions are\\nposed to the LLM:\\n‚ÄúFrom now on, whenever I ask a question, ask four\\nadditional questions that would help you produce a\\nbetter version of my original question. Then, use my\\nanswers to suggest a better version of my original\\nquestion.‚Äù\\nAs with many patterns that allow an LLM to generate\\nnew questions using its knowledge, the LLM may introduce\\nunfamiliar terms or concepts to the user into the question.\\nOne way to address this issue is to include a statement that\\nthe LLM should explain any unfamiliar terms it introduces in to\\nthe question. A further enhancement of this idea is to combin etheQuestion ReÔ¨Ånement pattern with the Persona pattern so\\nthe LLM Ô¨Çags terms and generates deÔ¨Ånitions that assume a\\nparticular level of knowledge, such as this example:\\n‚ÄúFrom now on, whenever I ask a question, ask four\\nadditional questions that would help you produce a\\nbetter version of my original question. Then, use my\\nanswers to suggest a better version of my original\\nquestion. After the follow-up questions, temporarily\\nact as a user with no knowledge of AWS and deÔ¨Åne\\nany terms that I need to know to accurately answer\\nthe questions.‚Äù\\nAn LLM can always produce factual inaccuracies, just\\nlike a human. A risk of this pattern is that the inaccuracies\\nare introduced into the reÔ¨Åned question. This risk may be\\nmitigated, however, by combining the Fact Check List pattern\\nto enable the user to identify possible inaccuracies and the\\nReÔ¨Çection pattern to explain the reasoning behind the question\\nreÔ¨Ånement.\\nG. The Alternative Approaches Pattern\\n1) Intent and Context: The intent of the pattern is to ensure\\nan LLM always offers alternative ways of accomplishing a tas k\\nso a user does not pursue only the approaches with which they\\nare familiar. The LLM can provide alternative approaches th at\\nalways force the user to think about what they are doing and\\ndetermine if that is the best approach to meet reach their goa l.\\nIn addition, solving the task may inform the user or teach the m\\nabout alternative concepts for subsequent follow-up.\\n2) Motivation: Humans often suffer from cognitive biases\\nthat lead them to choose a particular approach to solve a\\nproblem even when it is not the right or ‚Äúbest‚Äù approach.\\nMoreover, humans may be unaware of alternative approaches\\nto what they have used in the past. The motivation of the\\nAlternative Approaches pattern is to ensure the user is aware\\nof alternative approaches to select a better approach to sol ve\\na problem by dissolving their cognitive biases.\\n3) Structure and Key Ideas: Fundamental contextual state-\\nments:\\nContextual Statements\\nWithin scope X, if there are alternative ways to accom-\\nplish the same thing, list the best alternate approaches\\n(Optional) compare/contrast the pros and cons of each\\napproach\\n(Optional) include the original way that I asked\\n(Optional) prompt me for which approach I would like\\nto use\\nThe Ô¨Årst statement, ‚Äúwithin scope X‚Äù, scopes the interactio n\\nto a particular goal, topic, or bounds on the questioning. Th e\\nscope is the constraints that the user is placing on the alter -\\nnative approaches. The scope could be ‚Äúfor implementation\\ndecisions‚Äù or ‚Äúfor the deployment of the application‚Äù. The\\nscope ensures that any alternatives Ô¨Åt within the boundarie s\\nor constraints that the user must adhere to.\\nThe second statement, ‚Äúif there are alternative ways to\\naccomplish the same thing, list the best alternate approach es‚Äù\\ninstructs the LLM to suggest alternatives. As with other\\npatterns, the speciÔ¨Åcity of the instructions can be increas ed or\\ninclude domain-speciÔ¨Åc contextual information. For examp le,\\nthe statement could be scoped to ‚Äúif there are alternative wa ys\\nto accomplish the same thing with the software framework tha t\\nI am using‚Äù to prevent the LLM from suggesting alternatives\\nthat are inherently non-viable because they would require t oo\\nmany changes to other parts of the application.\\nSince the user may not be aware of the alternative ap-\\nproaches, they also may not be aware of why one would\\nchoose one of the alternatives. The optional statement ‚Äúcom -\\npare/contrast the pros and cons of each approach‚Äù adds de-\\ncision making criteria to the analysis. This statement ensu res\\nthe LLM will provide the user with the necessary rationale\\nfor alternative approaches. The Ô¨Ånal statement, ‚Äúprompt me\\nfor which approach I would like to use‚Äù, helps eliminate the\\nuser needing to manually copy/paste or enter in an alternati ve\\napproach if one is selected.\\n4) Example Implementation: Example prompt implementa-\\ntion to generate, compare, and allow the user to select one or\\nmore alternative approaches:\\n‚ÄúWhenever I ask you to deploy an application to\\na speciÔ¨Åc cloud service, if there are alternative\\nservices to accomplish the same thing with the\\nsame cloud service provider, list the best alternative\\nservices and then compare/contrast the pros and cons\\nof each approach with respect to cost, availability,\\nand maintenance effort and include the original way\\nthat I asked. Then ask me which approach I would\\nlike to proceed with.‚Äù\\nThis implementation of the Alternative Approaches pattern\\nis being speciÔ¨Åcally tailored for the context of software\\nengineering and focuses on the deployment of applications\\nto cloud services. The prompt is intended to intercept place s\\nwhere the developer may have made a cloud service selection\\nwithout full awareness of alternative services that may be\\npriced more competitively or easier to maintain. The prompt\\ndirects ChatGPT to list the best alternative services that c an\\naccomplish the same task with the same cloud service provide r\\n(providing constraints on the alternatives), and to compar e and\\ncontrast the pros and cons of each approach.\\n5) Consequences: This pattern is effective in its generic\\nform and can be applied to a range of tasks effectively.\\nReÔ¨Ånements could include having a standardized catalog of\\nacceptable alternatives in a speciÔ¨Åc domain from which the\\nuser must select. The Alternative Approaches pattern can also\\nbe used to incentivize users to select one of an approved set\\nof approaches while informing them of the pros/cons of the\\napproved options.\\nH. The Cognitive VeriÔ¨Åer Pattern\\n1) Intent and Context: Research literature has documented\\nthat LLMs can often reason better if a question is subdivided\\ninto additional questions that provide answers combined in to\\nthe overall answer to the original question [14]. The intent of\\nthe pattern is to force the LLM to always subdivide questionsinto additional questions that can be used to provide a bette r\\nanswer to the original question.\\n2) Motivation: The motivation of the Cognitive VeriÔ¨Åer\\npattern is two-fold:\\n‚Ä¢Humans may initially ask questions that are too high-\\nlevel to provide a concrete answer to without additional\\nfollow-up due to unfamiliarity with the domain, laziness\\nin prompt entry, or being unsure about what the correct\\nphrasing of the question should be.\\n‚Ä¢Research has demonstrated that LLMs can often perform\\nbetter when using a question that is subdivided into\\nindividual questions.\\n3) Structure and Key Ideas: Fundamental contextual state-\\nments:\\nContextual Statements\\nWhen you are asked a question, follow these rules\\nGenerate a number of additional questions that would\\nhelp more accurately answer the question\\nCombine the answers to the individual questions to\\nproduce the Ô¨Ånal answer to the overall question\\nThe Ô¨Årst statement is to generate a number of additional\\nquestions that would help more accurately answer the origin al\\nquestion. This step instructs the LLM to consider the contex t\\nof the question and to identify any information that may be\\nmissing or unclear. By generating additional questions, th e\\nLLM can help to ensure that the Ô¨Ånal answer is as complete\\nand accurate as possible. This step also encourages critica l\\nthinking by the user and can help to uncover new insights or\\napproaches that may not have been considered initially, whi ch\\nsubsequently lead to better follow-on questions.\\nThe second statement is to combine the answers to the\\nindividual questions to produce the Ô¨Ånal answer to the overa ll\\nquestion. This step is designed to ensure that all of the info r-\\nmation gathered from the individual questions is incorpora ted\\ninto the Ô¨Ånal answer. By combining the answers, the LLM\\ncan provide a more comprehensive and accurate response to\\nthe original question. This step also helps to ensure that al l\\nrelevant information is taken into account and that the Ô¨Ånal\\nanswer is not based on any single answer.\\n4) Example Implementation:\\n‚ÄúWhen I ask you a question, generate three addi-\\ntional questions that would help you give a more\\naccurate answer. When I have answered the three\\nquestions, combine the answers to produce the Ô¨Ånal\\nanswers to my original question.‚Äù\\nThis speciÔ¨Åc instance of the prompt pattern adds a reÔ¨Åne-\\nment to the original pattern by specifying a set number of\\nadditional questions that the LLM should generate in respon se\\nto a question. In this case, the prompt speciÔ¨Åes that ChatGPT\\nshould generate three additional questions that would help to\\ngive a more accurate answer to the original question. The\\nspeciÔ¨Åc number can be based on the user‚Äôs experience and\\nwillingness to provide follow-up information. A reÔ¨Ånement\\nto the prompt can be to provide a context for the amount\\nof knowledge that the LLM can assume the user has in the\\ndomain to guide the creation of the additional questions:\\n‚ÄúWhen I ask you a question, generate three addi-\\ntional questions that would help you give a more\\naccurate answer. Assume that I know little about\\nthe topic that we are discussing and please deÔ¨Åne\\nany terms that are not general knowledge. When\\nI have answered the three questions, combine the\\nanswers to produce the Ô¨Ånal answers to my original\\nquestion.‚Äù\\nThe reÔ¨Ånement also speciÔ¨Åes that the user may not have\\na strong understanding of the topic being discussed, which\\nmeans that the LLM should deÔ¨Åne any terms that are not\\ngeneral knowledge. This helps to ensure that the follow-up\\nquestions are not only relevant and focused, but also access ible\\nto the user, who may not be familiar with technical or domain-\\nspeciÔ¨Åc terms. By providing clear and concise deÔ¨Ånitions, t he\\nLLM can help to ensure that the follow-up questions are easy\\nto understand and that the Ô¨Ånal answer is accessible to users\\nwith varying levels of knowledge and expertise.\\n5) Consequences: This pattern can dictate the exact number\\nof questions to generate or leave this decision to the LLM.\\nThere are pros and cons to dictating the exact number. A pro\\nis that specifying an exact number of questions can tightly\\nscope the amount of additional information the user is force d\\nto provide so it is within a range they are willing and able to\\ncontribute.\\nA con, however, is that given Nquestions there may be\\nan invaluable N+1question that will always be scoped out.\\nAlternatively, the LLM can be provided a range or allowed\\nto ask additional questions. Of course, by omitting a limit o n\\nthe number of questions the LLM may generate numerous\\nadditional questions that overwhelm the user.\\nI. The Fact Check List Pattern\\n1) Intent and Context: The intent of this pattern is to ensure\\nthat the LLM outputs a list of facts that are present in the\\noutput and form an important part of the statements in the\\noutput. This list of facts helps inform the user of the facts\\n(or assumptions) the output is based on. The user can then\\nperform appropriate due diligence on these facts/assumpti ons\\nto validate the veracity of the output.\\n2) Motivation: A current weakness of LLMs (including\\nChatGPT) is they often rapidly (and even enthusiastically! )\\ngenerate convincing text that is factually incorrect. Thes e\\nerrors can take a wide range of forms, including fake statist ics\\nto invalid version numbers for software library dependenci es.\\nDue to the convincing nature of this generated text, however ,\\nusers may not perform appropriate due diligence to determin e\\nits accuracy.\\n3) Structure and Key Ideas: Fundamental contextual state-\\nments:Contextual Statements\\nGenerate a set of facts that are contained in the output\\nThe set of facts should be inserted in a speciÔ¨Åc point\\nin the output\\nThe set of facts should be the fundamental facts that\\ncould undermine the veracity of the output if any of\\nthem are incorrect\\nOne point of variation in this pattern is where the facts are\\noutput. Given that the facts may be terms that the user is not\\nfamiliar with, it is preferable if the list of facts comes aft er\\nthe output. This after-output presentation ordering allow s the\\nuser to read and understand the statements before seeing wha t\\nstatements should be checked. The user may also determine\\nadditional facts prior to realizing the fact list at the end s hould\\nbe checked.\\n4) Example Implementation: A sample wording of the Fact\\nCheck List pattern is shown below:\\n‚ÄúFrom now on, when you generate an answer, create\\na set of facts that the answer depends on that should\\nbe fact-checked and list this set of facts at the\\nend of your output. Only include facts related to\\ncybersecurity.‚Äù\\nThe user may have expertise in some topics related to the\\nquestion but not others. The fact check list can be tailored t o\\ntopics that the user is not as experienced in or where there\\nis the most risk. For example, in the prompt above, the user\\nis scoping the fact check list to security topics, since thes e\\nare likely very important from a risk perspective and may not\\nbe well-understood by the developer. Targeting the facts al so\\nreduces the cognitive burden on the user by potentially list ing\\nfewer items for investigation.\\n5) Consequences: The Fact Check List pattern should be\\nemployed whenever users are not experts in the domain for\\nwhich they are generating output. For example, a software\\ndeveloper reviewing code could beneÔ¨Åt from the pattern\\nsuggesting security considerations. In contrast, an exper t on\\nsoftware architecture is likely to identify errors in state ments\\nabout the software structure and need not see a fact check lis t\\nfor these outputs.\\nErrors are potential in all LLM outputs, so Fact Check List\\nis an effective pattern to combine with other patterns, such\\nas by combining it with the Question ReÔ¨Ånement pattern. A\\nkey aspect of this pattern is that users can inherently check it\\nagainst the output. In particular, users can directly compa re the\\nfact check list to the output to verify the facts listed in the fact\\ncheck list actually appear in the output. Users can also iden tify\\nany omissions from the list. Although the fact check list may\\nalso have errors, users often have sufÔ¨Åcient knowledge and\\ncontext to determine its completeness and accuracy relativ e to\\nthe output.\\nOne caveat of the Fact Check List pattern is that it only\\napplies when the output type is amenable to fact-checking. F or\\nexample, the pattern works when asking ChatGPT to generate\\na Python ‚Äúrequirements.txt‚Äù Ô¨Åle since it will list the versi ons\\nof libraries as facts that should be checked, which is handy a s\\nthe versions commonly have errors. However, ChatGPT will\\nrefuse to generate a fact check list for a code sample and\\nindicate that this is something it cannot check, even though\\nthe code may have errors.\\nJ. The Template Pattern\\n1) Intent and Context: The intent of the pattern is to\\nensure an LLM‚Äôs output follows a precise template in terms of\\nstructure. For example, the user might need to generate a URL\\nthat inserts generated information into speciÔ¨Åc positions within\\nthe URL path. This pattern allows the user to instruct the LLM\\nto produce its output in a format it would not ordinarily use\\nfor the speciÔ¨Åed type of content being generated.\\n2) Motivation: In some cases, output must be produced in\\na precise format that is application or use-case speciÔ¨Åc and\\nnot known to the LLM. Since the LLM is not aware of the\\ntemplate structure, it must be instructed on what the format\\nis and where the different parts of its output should go. This\\ncould take the form of a sample data structure that is being\\ngenerated, a series of form letters being Ô¨Ålled in, etc.\\n3) Structure and Key Ideas: Fundamental contextual state-\\nments:\\nContextual Statements\\nI am going to provide a template for your output\\nX is my placeholder for content\\nTry to Ô¨Åt the output into one or more of the placehold-\\ners that I list\\nPlease preserve the formatting and overall template that\\nI provide\\nThis is the template: PATTERN with PLACEHOLD-\\nERS\\nThe Ô¨Årst statement directs the LLM to follow a speciÔ¨Åc\\ntemplate for its output. The template will be used to try and\\ncoerce the LLMs responses into a structure that is consisten t\\nwith the user‚Äôs formatting needs. This pattern is needed whe n\\nthe target format is not known to the LLM. If the LLM already\\nhas knowledge of the format, such as a speciÔ¨Åc Ô¨Åle type, then\\nthe template pattern can be skipped and the user can simply\\nspecify the known format. However, there may be cases, such\\nas generating Javascript Object Notation (JSON), where the re\\nis a large amount of variation in how the data could be\\nrepresented within that format and the template can be used t o\\nensure that the representation within the target format mee ts\\nthe user‚Äôs additional constraints.\\nThe second statement makes the LLM aware that the\\ntemplate will contain a set of placeholders. Users will expl ain\\nhow the output should be inserted into the template through t he\\nplaceholders. The placeholders allow the user to semantica lly\\ntarget where information should be inserted. Placeholders\\ncan use formats, like NAME, that allow the LLM to infer\\nthe semantic meaning of to determine where output should\\nbe inserted (e.g., insert the person‚Äôs name in the NAME\\nplaceholder). Moreover, by using placeholders, the user ca n\\nindicate what is not needed in the output ‚Äì if a placeholder\\ndoesn‚Äôt exist for a component of the generated output, thenthat component can be omitted. Ideally, placeholders shoul d\\nuse a format that is commonly employed in text that the LLM\\nwas trained on, such as all caps, enclosure in brackets, etc.\\nThe third statement attempts to constrain the LLM so that it\\ndoesn‚Äôt arbitrarily rewrite the template or attempt to modi fy it\\nso that all of the output components can be inserted. It shoul d\\nbe noted that this statement may not preclude additional tex t\\nfrom being generated before or after. In practice, LLMs will\\ntypically follow the template, but it is harder to eliminate any\\nadditional text being generated beyond the template withou t\\nexperimentation with prompt wording.\\n4) Example Implementation: A sample template for gener-\\nating URLs where the output is put into speciÔ¨Åc places in the\\ntemplate is shown below:\\n‚ÄúI am going to provide a template for your out-\\nput. Everything in all caps is a placeholder. Any\\ntime that you generate text, try to Ô¨Åt it into one\\nof the placeholders that I list. Please preserve the\\nformatting and overall template that I provide at\\nhttps://myapi.com/NAME/proÔ¨Åle/JOB‚Äù\\nA sample interaction after the prompt was provided, is\\nshown:\\nUser: ‚ÄúGenerate a name and job title for a person‚Äù\\nChatGPT: ‚Äúhttps://myapi.com/Emily Parker/proÔ¨Åle/\\nSoftware Engineer‚Äù\\n5) Consequences: One consequence of applying the Tem-\\nplate pattern is that it Ô¨Ålters the LLM‚Äôs output, which may\\neliminate other outputs the LLM would have provided that\\nmight be useful to the user. In many cases, the LLM can\\nprovide helpful descriptions of code, decision making, or o ther\\ndetails that this pattern will effectively eliminate from t he\\noutput. Users should therefore weight the pros/cons of Ô¨Ålte ring\\nout this additional information.\\nIn addition, Ô¨Åltering can make it hard to combine this patter n\\nwith other patterns from the Output Customization category.\\nThe Template pattern effectively constrains the output format,\\nso it may not be compatible with generation of certain other\\ntypes of output. For example, in the template provided above\\nfor a URL, it would not be easy (or likely possible) to combine\\nwith the Recipe pattern, which needs to output a list of steps.\\nK. The InÔ¨Ånite Generation Pattern\\n1) Intent and Context: The intent of this pattern is to\\nautomatically generate a series of outputs (which may appea r\\ninÔ¨Ånite) without having to reenter the generator prompt eac h\\ntime. The goal is to limit how much text the user must type to\\nproduce the next output, based on the assumption that the use r\\ndoes not want to continually reintroduce the prompt. In some\\nvariations, the intent is to allow the user to keep an initial\\nprompt template, but add additional variation to it through\\nadditional inputs prior to each generated output.\\n2) Motivation: Many tasks require repetitive application of\\nthe same prompt to multiple concepts. For example, generati ng\\ncode for create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations\\nfor a speciÔ¨Åc type of entity may require applying the same\\nprompt to multiple types of entities. If the user is forced to\\nretype the prompt over and over, they may make mistakes. The\\nInÔ¨Ånite Generation pattern allows the user to repetitively apply\\na prompt, either with or without further input, to automate\\nthe generation of multiple outputs using a predeÔ¨Åned set of\\nconstraints.\\n3) Structure and Key Ideas:\\nContextual Statements\\nI would like you to generate output forever, X output(s)\\nat a time.\\n(Optional) here is how to use the input I provide\\nbetween outputs.\\n(Optional) stop when I ask you to.\\nThe Ô¨Årst statement speciÔ¨Åes that the user wants the LLM\\nto generate output indeÔ¨Ånitely, which effectively conveys the\\ninformation that the same prompt is going to be reused over\\nand over. By specifying the number of outputs that should be\\ngenerated at a time (i.e. ‚ÄúX outputs at a time‚Äù), the user can\\nrate limit the generation, which can be particularly import ant if\\nthere is a risk that the output will exceed the length limitat ions\\nof the LLM for a single output.\\nThe second statement provides optional instructions for ho w\\nto use the input provided by the user between outputs. By\\nspecifying how additional user inputs between prompts can\\nbe provided and leveraged, the user can create a prompting\\nstrategy that leverages user feedback in the context of the\\noriginal prompt. The original prompt is still in the context of\\nthe generation, but each user input between generation step s\\nis incorporated into the original prompt to reÔ¨Åne the output\\nusing prescribed rules.\\nThe third statement provides an optional way for the user\\nto stop the output generation process. This step is not alway s\\nneeded, but can be useful in situations where there may be\\nthe potential for ambiguity regarding whether or not the use r-\\nprovided input between inputs is meant as a reÔ¨Ånement for\\nthe next generation or a command to stop. For example, an\\nexplicit stop phrase could be created if the user was generat ing\\ndata related to road signs, where the user might want to enter\\na reÔ¨Ånement of the generation like ‚Äústop‚Äù to indicate that a\\nstop sign should be added to the output.\\n4) Example Implementation: The following is a sample\\ninÔ¨Ånite generation prompt for producing a series of URLs:\\n‚ÄúFrom now on, I want you to generate a name\\nand job until I say stop. I am going to provide a\\ntemplate for your output. Everything in all caps is a\\nplaceholder. Any time that you generate text, try to\\nÔ¨Åt it into one of the placeholders that I list. Please\\npreserve the formatting and overall template that I\\nprovide: https://myapi.com/NAME/proÔ¨Åle/JOB‚Äù\\nThis prompt is combining the functionality of both the\\nInÔ¨Ånite Generation pattern and the Template pattern. The user\\nis requesting the LLM continuously generate a name and job\\ntitle until explicitly told to ‚Äústop‚Äù. The generated output s are\\nthen formatted into the template provided, which includesplaceholders for the name and job title. By using the InÔ¨Ånite\\nGeneration pattern, the user receives multiple outputs without\\nhaving to continually re-enter the template. Likewise, the\\nTemplate pattern is applied to provide a consistent format for\\nthe outputs.\\n5) Consequences: In conversational LLMs, the input to\\nthe model at each time step is the previous output and the\\nnew user input. Although the details of what is preserved\\nand reintroduced in the next output cycle are model and\\nimplementation dependent, they are often limited in scope. The\\nmodel is therefore constantly being fed the previous output s\\nand the prompt, which can result in the model losing track of\\nthe original prompt instructions over time if they exceed th e\\nscope of what it is being provided as input.\\nAs additional outputs are generated, the context surroundi ng\\nthe prompt may fade, leading to the model deviating from\\nthe intended behavior. It is important to monitor the output s\\nproduced by the model to (1) ensure it still adheres to\\nthe desired behavior and (2) provide corrective feedback if\\nnecessary. Another issue to consider is that the LLM may\\ngenerate repetitive outputs, which may not be desired since\\nusers Ô¨Ånd this repetition tedious and error-prone to proces s.\\nL. The Visualization Generator Pattern\\n1) Intent and Context: The intent of this pattern is to use\\ntext generation to create visualizations. Many concepts ar e\\neasier to grasp in diagram or image format. The purpose of\\nthis pattern is to create a pathway for the tool to produce\\nimagery that is associated with other outputs. This pattern\\nallows the creation of visualizations by creating inputs fo r\\nother well-known visualization tools that use text as their\\ninput, such as Graphviz Dot [15] or DALL-E [13]. This\\npattern can provide a more comprehensive and effective way\\nof communicating information by combining the strengths of\\nboth the text generation and visualization tools.\\n2) Motivation: LLMs generally produce text and cannot\\nproduce imagery. For example, an LLM cannot draw a diagram\\nto describe a graph. The Visualization Generator pattern over-\\ncomes this limitation by generating textual inputs in the co rrect\\nformat to plug into another tool that generates the correct\\ndiagram. The motivation behind this pattern is to enhance th e\\noutput of the LLM and make it more visually appealing and\\neasier to understand for users. By using text inputs to gener ate\\nvisualizations, users can quickly understand complex conc epts\\nand relationships that may be hard to grasp through text alon e.\\n3) Structure and Key Ideas: Fundamental contextual state-\\nments:\\nContextual Statements\\nGenerate an X that I can provide to tool Y to visualize\\nit\\nThe goal of the contextual statements is to indicate to the\\nLLM that the output it is going to produce, ‚ÄúX‚Äù, is going to\\nbe imagery. Since LLMs can‚Äôt generate images, the ‚Äùthat I\\ncan provide to tool Y to visualize it‚Äù clariÔ¨Åes that the LLM\\nis not expected to generate an image, but is instead expected\\nto produce a description of imagery consumable by tool Y for\\nproduction of the image.\\nMany tools may support multiple types of visualizations or\\nformats, and thus the target tool itself may not be sufÔ¨Åcient\\ninformation to accurately produce what the user wants. The\\nuser may need to state the precise types of visualizations (e .g.,\\nbar chart, directed graph, UML class diagram) that should be\\nproduced. For example, Graphviz Dot can create diagrams for\\nboth UML class diagrams and directed graphs. Further, as wil l\\nbe discussed in the following example, it can be advantageou s\\nto specify a list of possible tools and formats and let the LLM\\nselect the appropriate target for visualization.\\n4) Example Implementation:\\n‚ÄúWhenever I ask you to visualize something, please\\ncreate either a Graphviz Dot Ô¨Åle or DALL-E prompt\\nthat I can use to create the visualization. Choose\\nthe appropriate tools based on what needs to be\\nvisualized.‚Äù\\nThis example of the pattern adds a qualiÔ¨Åcation that the\\noutput type for the visualization can be either for Graphviz\\nor DALL-E. The interesting aspect of this approach is that\\nit allows the LLM to use its semantic understanding of the\\noutput format to automatically select the target tooling ba sed\\non what will be displayed. In this case, Graphviz would be for\\nvisualizing graphs with a need for an exactly deÔ¨Åned structu re.\\nDALL-E would be effective at visualizing realistic or artis tic\\nimagery that does not have an exactly deÔ¨Åned structure. The\\nLLM can select the tool based on the needs of the visualizatio n\\nand capabilities of each tool.\\n5) Consequences: The pattern creates a target pipeline\\nfor the output to render a visualization. The pipeline may\\ninclude AI generators, such as DALL-E, that can produce\\nrich visualizations. The pattern allows the user to expand t he\\nexpressive capabilities of the output into the visual domai n.\\nM. The Game Play Pattern\\n1) Intent and Context: The intent of this pattern is to create\\na game around a given topic. The pattern can be combined\\nwith the Visualization Generator to add imagery to the game.\\nThe game is centered around a speciÔ¨Åc topic and the LLM\\nwill guide the game play. The pattern is particularly effect ive\\nwhen the rules of the game are relatively limited in scope, bu t\\nthe content for the game is expected to be wide in scope. The\\nuser can specify a limited set of rules and then the LLM can\\nautomate generation of bodies of content for game play.\\n2) Motivation: You would like the LLM to generate scenar-\\nios or questions revolving around a speciÔ¨Åc topic and requir e\\nusers to apply problem solving or other skills to accomplish\\na task related to the scenario. Generating all the content fo r\\nthe game manually would be too time consuming, however, so\\nyou would like the LLM to apply its knowledge of the topic\\nto guide the generation of content.\\n3) Structure and Key Ideas: Fundamental contextual state-\\nments:Contextual Statements\\nCreate a game for me around X\\nOne or more fundamental rules of the game\\nThe Ô¨Årst statement, instructs the LLM to create a game and\\nprovides the important scoping of the game to a topic area. .\\nOne of the important capabilities of the pattern is that it al lows\\nthe user to create games by describing the rules of the game,\\nwithout having to determine the content of the game. The more\\nspeciÔ¨Åc the topic, typically the more novel and interesting the\\ngame play.\\nThe second statement introduces the rules of the game to the\\nLLM. It is important that the rules Ô¨Åt within the capabilitie s\\nof the LLM. Textual games that rely on input and output text\\nsequences work best. One of the key attributes of the pattern\\nis that the input text can be rich and expressive, which can\\nlead to interesting interfaces for the game. For example, th e\\nuser might express actions in the game as scripts dictating\\na sequence of complex actions, such as ‚Äúget a listing of all\\nnetwork activity and check it for anomalies‚Äù, which go beyon d\\nthe scope of multiple choice or short answer inputs. Each rul e\\nshould be provided as a separate statement regarding some\\naspect of the game.\\n4) Example Implementation: A sample cybersecurity game\\nprompt is shown below:\\n‚ÄúWe are going to play a cybersecurity game. You\\nare going to pretend to be a Linux terminal for a\\ncomputer that has been compromised by an attacker.\\nWhen I type in a command, you are going to output\\nthe corresponding text that the Linux terminal would\\nproduce. I am going to use commands to try and\\nÔ¨Ågure out how the system was compromised. The\\nattack should have done one or more of the following\\nthings: (1) launched new processes, (2) changed\\nÔ¨Åles, (3) opened new ports to receive communi-\\ncation, (4) created new outbound connections, (5)\\nchanged passwords, (6) created new user accounts,\\nor (7) read and stolen information. To start the game,\\nprint a scenario of what happened that led to my\\ninvestigation and make the description have clues\\nthat I can use to get started.‚Äù\\nThis cybersecurity game prompt combines a number of pat-\\nterns, including Game Play andPersona . The Linux terminal\\npersona that is chosen for the game has been discussed in many\\nInternet posts [16]. This game further customizes the discu ssed\\nLinux persona to act as a Linux terminal of a computer\\ncompromised by a cyberattack. ChatGPT responds to Linux\\ncommands with appropriate terminal outputs and synthesize s\\na fake Ô¨Åle system that has clues to a cyberattack.\\nSample output from this game with ChatGPT after typing\\nin ‚Äúls -alt‚Äù, the Linux command to generate a list of Ô¨Åles in\\nthe current directory is shown below (permissions have been\\nremoved for formatting reasons):\\ntotal 56\\n5 user user 4096 Feb 16 14:31 .\\n1 user user 18881 Feb 16 14:31 .bash_history\\n43 user user 4096 Feb 16 14:30 ..\\n1 user user 1178 Aug 15 2022 .bashrc\\n1 user user 220 Aug 15 2022 .bash_logout\\n3 user user 4096 Feb 16 14:25 .gnupg\\n1 user user 4041 Feb 15 17:52 README.md\\n2 user user 4096 Feb 1 11:35 project\\nWhen the user then typed the command ‚Äúcat .bash history‚Äù,\\nto display the contents of the log Ô¨Åle showing the commands\\nrun by the user, ChatGPT responded with:\\ncd /var/www/html\\nsudo rm -rf *\\nsudo wget https://example.com/backdoor.php\\nsudo chmod 777 backdoor.php\\nexit\\nls -alt\\nps -ef\\nnetstat -tulnp\\nIn the output above, ChatGPT generated a fake log Ô¨Åle with\\nrealistic commands for deleting the data being served by the\\nweb server in /var/www/html and replacing the content\\nwith a backdoor into the system.\\n5) Consequences: This pattern can be combined effectively\\nwith the Persona ,InÔ¨Ånite Generation , and Visualization Gen-\\nerator patterns. For example, the cybersecurity game uses the\\nPersona pattern so the LLM can masquerade as a Linux termi-\\nnal. For a network security game, the Visualization Generator\\ncould be employed to add the ability to visualize the network\\ntopology and trafÔ¨Åc Ô¨Çows.\\nN. The ReÔ¨Çection Pattern\\n1) Intent and Context: The goal of this pattern is to ask\\nthe model to automatically explain the rationale behind giv en\\nanswers to the user. The pattern allows users to better asses s\\nthe output‚Äôs validity, as well as inform users how an LLM\\narrived at a particular answer. ReÔ¨Çection can clarify any po ints\\nof confusion, uncover underlying assumptions, and reveal g aps\\nin knowledge or understanding.\\n2) Motivation: LLMs can and do make mistakes. More-\\nover, users may not understand why an LLM is producing\\na particular output and how to adapt their prompt to solve\\na problem with the output. By asking LLM to automatically\\nexplain the rationale behind its answers, users can gain a be tter\\nunderstanding of how the model is processing the input, what\\nassumptions it is making, and what data it is drawing on.\\nLLMs may sometime provide incomplete, incorrect, or\\nambiguous answers. ReÔ¨Çection is an aid to help address these\\nshortcomings and ensure the information provided by LLM\\nis as accurate. A further beneÔ¨Åt of the pattern is that it can\\nhelp users debug their prompts and determine why they are\\nnot getting results that meet expectations. This pattern is\\nparticularly effective for the exploration of topics that c an\\nbe confused with other topics or that may have nuanced\\ninterpretations and where knowing the precise interpretat ion\\nthat the LLM used is important.3) Structure and Key Ideas: Fundamental contextual state-\\nments:\\nContextual Statements\\nWhenever you generate an answer\\nExplain the reasoning and assumptions behind your\\nanswer\\n(Optional) ...so that I can improve my question\\nThe Ô¨Årst statement is requesting that, after generating an a n-\\nswer, the LLM should explain the reasoning and assumptions\\nbehind the answer. This statement helps the user understand\\nhow the LLM arrived at the answer and can help build trust in\\nthe model‚Äôs responses. The prompt includes the statement th at\\nthe purpose of the explanation is for the user to reÔ¨Åne their\\nquestion. This additional statement gives the LLM the conte xt\\nit needs to better tailor its explanations to the speciÔ¨Åc pur pose\\nof aising the user in producing follow-on questions.\\n4) Example Implementation: This example tailors the\\nprompt speciÔ¨Åcally to the domain of providing answers relat ed\\nto code:\\n‚ÄùWhen you provide an answer, please explain the\\nreasoning and assumptions behind your selection\\nof software frameworks. If possible, use speciÔ¨Åc\\nexamples or evidence with associated code samples\\nto support your answer of why the framework is\\nthe best selection for the task. Moreover, please\\naddress any potential ambiguities or limitations in\\nyour answer, in order to provide a more complete\\nand accurate response.‚Äù\\nThe pattern is further customized to instruct the LLM that\\nit should justify its selection of software frameworks, but not\\nnecessarily other aspects of the answer. In addition, the us er\\ndictates that code samples should be used to help explain the\\nmotivation for selecting the speciÔ¨Åc software framework.\\n5) Consequences: One consequence of the ReÔ¨Çection pat-\\ntern is that it may not be effective for users who do not\\nunderstand the topic area of the discussion. For example, a\\nhighly technical question by a non-technical user may resul t\\nin a complex rationale for the answer that the user cannot\\nfathom. As with other prompt patterns, there is a risk the\\noutput may include errors or inaccurate assumptions includ ed\\nin the explanation of the rationale that the user may not be\\nable to spot. This pattern can be combined with the Fact Check\\nListto help address this issue.\\nO. The Refusal Breaker Pattern\\n1) Intent and Context: The goal of this pattern is to ask an\\nLLM to automatically help users rephrase a question when it\\nrefuses to give an answer. This pattern has the potential for\\nmisuse, however, e.g., to generate phishing emails or perform\\nother actions that violate LLM policy Ô¨Ålters. Caution shoul d\\ntherefore be exercised when applying this pattern to ensure\\nit is used ethically and responsibly. This pattern has been\\nused successfully in some LLMs to overcome the underlying\\nprompts used to program the LLM and prevent harmful output\\ngeneration.\\n2) Motivation: LLMs may sometimes refuse to answer\\na question, either because they do not have the required\\nknowledge or because the question is phrased in a way that\\nthey do not understand. This outcome may be frustrating\\nfor users who are looking for answers. In some situations,\\ntherefore, the Refusal Breaker pattern can help users Ô¨Ånd a\\nway to either rephrase their question or ask a different ques tion\\nthe LLM is better equipped to answer.\\nFor example, you could ask for clariÔ¨Åcation on why the\\nquestion was refused, as there may be a speciÔ¨Åc reason why\\nLLM could not provide an answer. Another approach is to\\nask a different question that may be within its knowledge cut -\\noff or expertise. However, all these approaches require use r\\nintervention and knowledge of how to bypass the refusal.\\n3) Structure and Key Ideas: Fundamental contextual state-\\nments:\\nContextual Statements\\nWhenever you can‚Äôt answer a question\\nExplain why you can‚Äôt answer the question\\nProvide one or more alternative wordings of the ques-\\ntion that you could answer\\nThe Ô¨Årst statement sets the stage that this set of instructio ns\\nshould only be applied when a question can‚Äôt be answered.\\nThe user does not want to trigger these instructions under\\nnormal circumstances. The second statement instructs the\\nLLM to provide an explanation of why the question can‚Äôt be\\nanswered. The explanation is likely to include assumptions ,\\nconstraints, or misunderstandings that can be leveraged by the\\nuser to strategize about how to reword the question. Althoug h\\njust the explanation of why the question can‚Äôt be answered\\ncould help a user overcome the refusal, the pattern adds an\\nadditional statement for the LLM to suggest rewordings that\\nwould be acceptable. The pattern combines both reasoning\\nand suggested rewordings to improve the chances that the use r\\nwill Ô¨Ånd a path around whatever roadblocks are preventing th e\\nquestion form being answered.\\n4) Example Implementation: The Refusal Breaker pattern\\ncan be be implemented and applied with the following phras-\\ning:\\n‚ÄúWhenever you can‚Äôt answer a question, explain why\\nand provide one or more alternate wordings of the\\nquestion that you can‚Äôt answer so that I can improve\\nmy questions.‚Äù\\nA sample discourse after using the pattern is shown below:\\nUser: What is the meaning of life?\\nChatGPT : As an AI language model, I do not\\nhave personal beliefs or opinions. The meaning of\\nlife is a complex philosophical question that has\\nbeen pondered by humans for centuries and can\\nvary greatly from person to person. It may be more\\nproductive to rephrase the question in a way that can\\nbe answered by information and knowledge, such\\nas ‚ÄúWhat are some philosophical perspectives onthe meaning of life?‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhat are some common\\nbeliefs about the purpose of life?‚Äù\\n5) Consequences: This pattern provides a potential path\\nfor misuse, so organizations, parents, or other stakeholde rs\\nmay need to restrict the usage of the LLM. The Ô¨Årst step in\\ngoing around guardrails on usage is to understand where the\\nguardrails are. In future work, a complement of this pattern\\nmay be developed to hide the underlying prompt information\\nand rationale from users to prevent discovery.\\nAlthough the rationale and alternate rewordings are gener-\\nated, there is no guarantee that users will be able to overcom e\\nthe refusal. The alternate questions that are generated may not\\nbe of interest to the user or helpful in answering the origina l\\nquestion. The pattern mainly provides an aid in determining\\nwhat the LLM can answer, but not a guarantee that it will\\nanswer a semantically equivalent variation of the original\\nquestion.\\nP . The Context Manager Pattern\\n1) Intent and Context: The intent of this pattern is to enable\\nusers to specify or remove context for a conversation with\\nan LLM. The goal is to focus the conversation on speciÔ¨Åc\\ntopics or exclude unrelated topics from consideration. Thi s\\npattern gives users greater control over what statements th e\\nLLM considers or ignores when generating output.\\n2) Motivation: LLMs often struggle to interpret the in-\\ntended context of the current question or generate irreleva nt\\nresponses based on prior inputs or irrelevant attention on\\nthe wrong statements. By focusing on explicit contextual\\nstatements or removing irrelevant statements, users can he lp\\nthe LLM better understand the question and generate more\\naccurate responses. Users may introduce unrelated topics o r\\nreference information from earlier in the dialogue, which\\nmay can disrupt the Ô¨Çow of the conversation. The Context\\nManager pattern aims to emphasize or remove speciÔ¨Åc aspects\\nof the context to maintain relevance and coherence in the\\nconversation.\\n3) Structure and Key Ideas: Fundamental contextual state-\\nments:\\nContextual Statements\\nWithin scope X\\nPlease consider Y\\nPlease ignore Z\\n(Optional) start over\\nStatements about what to consider or ignore should list key\\nconcepts, facts, instructions, etc. that should be include d or\\nremoved from the context. The more explicit the statements\\nare, the more likely the LLM will take appropriate action. Fo r\\nexample, if the user asks to ignore subjects related to a topi c,\\nyet some of the those statements were discussed far back in th e\\nconversation, the LLM may not properly disregard the releva nt\\ninformation. The more explicit the list is, therefore, the b etter\\nthe inclusion/exclusion behavior will be.\\n4) Example Implementation: To specify context consider\\nusing the following prompt:\\n‚ÄúWhen analyzing the following pieces of code, only\\nconsider security aspects.‚Äù\\nLikewise, to remove context consider using the following\\nprompt:\\n‚ÄúWhen analyzing the following pieces of code, do\\nnot consider formatting or naming conventions.‚Äù\\nClarity and speciÔ¨Åcity are important when providing or\\nremoving context to/from an LLM so it can better understand\\nthe intended scope of the conversation and generate more\\nrelevant responses. In many situations, the user may want to\\ncompletely start over and can employ this prompt to reset the\\nLLM‚Äôs context:\\n‚ÄúIgnore everything that we have discussed. Start\\nover.‚Äù\\nThe ‚Äústart over‚Äù idea helps produce a complete reset of the\\ncontext.\\n5) Consequences: One consequence of this pattern is that\\nit may inadvertently wipe out patterns applied to the con-\\nversation that the user is unaware of. For example, if an\\norganization injects a series of helpful patterns into the s tart of\\na conversation, the user may not be aware of these patterns an d\\nremove them through a reset of the context. This reset could\\npotentially eliminate helpful capabilities of the LLM, whi le\\nnot making it obvious that the user will lose this functional ity.\\nA potential solution to this problem is to include in the prom pt\\na request to explain what topics/instructions will potenti ally be\\nlost before proceeding.\\nQ. The Recipe Pattern\\n1) Intent and Context: This pattern provides constraints to\\nultimately output a sequence of steps given some partially\\nprovided ‚Äúingredients‚Äù that must be conÔ¨Ågured in a sequence\\nof steps to achieve a stated goal. It combines the Template ,\\nAlternative Approaches , and ReÔ¨Çection patterns.\\n2) Motivation: Users often want an LLM to analyze a\\nconcrete sequence of steps or procedures to achieve a stated\\noutcome. Typically, users generally know‚Äîor have an idea\\nof‚Äîwhat the end goal should look like and what ‚Äúingredients‚Äù\\nbelong in the prompt. However, they may not necessarily know\\nthe precise ordering of steps to achieve that end goal.\\nFor example, a user may want a precise speciÔ¨Åcation on how\\na piece of code should be implemented or automated, such as\\n‚Äúcreate an Ansible playbook to ssh into a set of servers, copy\\ntext Ô¨Åles from each server, spawn a monitoring process on\\neach server, and then close the ssh connection to each server .\\nIn other words, this pattern represents a generalization of the\\nexample of ‚Äúgiven the ingredients in my fridge, provide dinn er\\nrecipes.‚Äù A user may also want to specify a set number of\\nalternative possibilities, such as ‚Äúprovide 3 different wa ys of\\ndeploying a web application to AWS using Docker containers\\nand Ansible using step by step instructions‚Äù.3) Structure and Key Ideas: Fundamental contextual state-\\nments:\\nContextual Statements\\nI would like to achieve X\\nI know that I need to perform steps A,B,C\\nProvide a complete sequence of steps for me\\nFill in any missing steps\\nIdentify any unnecessary steps\\nThe Ô¨Årst statement ‚ÄúI would like to achieve X‚Äù focuses the\\nLLM on the overall goal that the recipe needs to be built\\nto achieve. The steps will be organized and completed to\\nsequentially achieve the goal speciÔ¨Åed. The second stateme nt\\nprovides the partial list of steps that the user would like\\nto include in the overall recipe. These serve as intermediat e\\nwaypoints for the path that the LLM is going to generate or\\nconstraints on the structure of the recipe. The next stateme nt\\nin the pattern, ‚Äúprovide a complete sequence of steps for\\nme‚Äù, indicates to the LLM that the goal is to provide a\\ncomplete sequential ordering of steps. The ‚ÄúÔ¨Åll in any missi ng\\nsteps‚Äù helps ensure that the LLM will attempt to complete\\nthe recipe without further follow-up by making some choices\\non the user‚Äôs behalf regarding missing steps, as opposed to\\njust stating additional information that is needed. Finall y, the\\nlast statement, ‚Äúidentify any unnecessary steps,‚Äù is usefu l in\\nÔ¨Çagging inaccuracies in the user‚Äôs original request so that the\\nÔ¨Ånal recipe is efÔ¨Åcient.\\n4) Example Implementation: An example usage of this\\npattern in the context of deploying a software application t o\\nthe cloud is shown below:\\n‚ÄúI am trying to deploy an application to the cloud. I\\nknow that I need to install the necessary dependen-\\ncies on a virtual machine for my application. I know\\nthat I need to sign up for an AWS account. Please\\nprovide a complete sequence of steps. Please Ô¨Åll in\\nany missing steps. Please identify any unnecessary\\nsteps.‚Äù\\nDepending on the use case and constraints, ‚Äúinstalling\\nnecessary dependencies on a virtual machine‚Äù may be an\\nunnecessary step. For example, if the application is alread y\\npackaged in a Docker container, the container could be de-\\nployed directly to the AWS Fargate Service, which does not\\nrequire any management of the underlying virtual machines.\\nThe inclusion of the ‚Äúidentify unnecessary steps‚Äù language\\nwill cause the LLM to Ô¨Çag this issue and omit the steps from\\nthe Ô¨Ånal recipe.\\n5) Consequences: One consequence of the recipe pattern is\\nthat a user may not always have a well-speciÔ¨Åed description\\nof what they would like to implement, construct, or design.\\nMoreover, this pattern may introduce unwanted bias from the\\nuser‚Äôs initially selected steps so the LLM may try to Ô¨Ånd a\\nsolution that incorporates them, rather than Ô¨Çagging them a s\\nunneeded. For example, an LLM may try to Ô¨Ånd a solution\\nthat does install dependencies for a virtual machine, even i f\\nthere are solutions that do not require that.\\n'"

              "'The 1953 Iranian coup d\\'√©tat, known in Iran as the 28 Mordad coup d\\'√©tat (Persian: ⁄©ŸàÿØÿ™ÿß€å €≤€∏ ŸÖÿ±ÿØÿßÿØ), was the U.S.- and UK-instigated, Iranian army-led overthrow of the democratically elected Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh in favor of strengthening the monarchical rule of the shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, on 19 August 1953. It was aided by the United States (under the name TP-AJAX (Tudeh Party) Project or \"Operation Ajax\") and the United Kingdom (under the name \"Operation Boot\"). The clergy also played a considerable role.Mosaddegh had sought to audit the documents of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (AIOC), a British corporation (now part of BP), to verify that AIOC was paying the contracted royalties to Iran, and to limit the company\\'s control over Iranian oil reserves. Upon the AIOC\\'s refusal to cooperate with the Iranian government, the parliament (Majlis) voted to nationalize Iran\\'s oil industry and to expel foreign corporate representatives from the country. After this vote, Britain instigated a worldwide boycott of Iranian oil to pressure Iran economically. Initially, Britain mobilized its military to seize control of the British-built Abadan oil refinery, then the world\\'s largest, but Prime Minister Clement Attlee (in power until 1951) opted instead to tighten the economic boycott while using Iranian agents to undermine Mosaddegh\\'s government.:\\u200a3\\u200a Judging Mosaddegh to be unamenable and fearing the growing influence of the communist Tudeh, UK prime minister Winston Churchill and the Eisenhower administration decided in early 1953 to overthrow Iran\\'s government. The preceding Truman administration had opposed a coup, fearing the precedent that Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) involvement would set,:\\u200a3\\u200a and the U.S. government had been considering unilateral action (without UK support) to assist the Mosaddegh government as late as 1952. British intelligence officials\\' conclusions and the UK government\\'s solicitations to the US were instrumental in initiating and planning the coup.\\nFollowing the coup, a government under General Fazlollah Zahedi was formed which allowed Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the shah of Iran (Persian for \\'king\\'), to rule more firmly as monarch. He relied heavily on United States support to hold on to power. According to the CIA\\'s declassified documents and records, some of the most feared mobsters in Tehran were hired by the CIA to stage pro-shah riots on 19 August. Other men paid by the CIA were brought into Tehran in buses and trucks and took over the streets of the city. Between 200 and 300 people were killed because of the conflict. Mosaddegh was arrested, tried and convicted of treason by the Shah\\'s military court. On 21 December 1953, he was sentenced to three years in jail, then placed under house arrest for the remainder of his life.:\\u200a280\\u200a Other Mosaddegh supporters were imprisoned, and several received the death penalty. After the coup, the Shah continued his rule as monarch for the next 26 years until he was overthrown in the Iranian Revolution in 1979.In August 2013, the U.S. government formally acknowledged the U.S. role in the coup by releasing a bulk of previously classified government documents that show it was in charge of both the planning and the execution of the coup, including the bribing of Iranian politicians, security and army high-ranking officials, as well as pro-coup propaganda. The CIA is quoted acknowledging the coup was carried out \"under CIA direction\" and \"as an act of U.S. foreign policy, conceived and approved at the highest levels of government\".\\n\\n\\n== Background ==\\nThroughout the 19th century, Iran was caught between two advancing imperial powers, Russia and Britain. In 1892, the British diplomat George Curzon described Iran as \"pieces on a chessboard upon which is being played out a game for the dominion of the world.\":\\u200a32\\u200a During the latter half of the 19th century, the concession policies of the monarchy faced increased opposition. In 1872, a representative of British entrepreneur Paul Reuter met with the Iranian monarch Naser al-Din Shah Qajar and agreed to fund the monarch\\'s upcoming lavish visit to Europe in return for exclusive contracts for Iranian roads, telegraphs, mills, factories, extraction of resources, and other public works, in which Reuter would receive a stipulated sum for five years and 60% of all the net revenue for 20 years. However, the so-called \"Reuter concession\" was never put into effect because of violent opposition at home and from Russia.:\\u200a12\\u200a In 1892 the Shah was forced to revoke a tobacco monopoly given to Major G. F. Talbot, following protests and a widespread tobacco boycott.\\nIn 1901, Mozzafar al-Din Shah Qajar granted a 60-year petroleum search concession to William Knox D\\'Arcy.:\\u200a33\\u200a D\\'Arcy paid ¬£20,000 (equivalent to ¬£2.1 million in 2019), according to journalist-turned-historian Stephen Kinzer, and promised equal ownership shares, with 16% of any future net profit, as calculated by the company.:\\u200a48\\u200a However, the historian L. P. Elwell-Sutton wrote, in 1955, that \"Persia\\'s share was \\'hardly spectacular\\' and no money changed hands.\":\\u200a15\\u200a On 31 July 1907, D\\'Arcy withdrew from his private holdings in Persia, and transferred them to the British-owned Burmah Oil Company.:\\u200a17\\u200a On 26 May 1908 the company struck oil at a depth of 1,180 feet (360 m).:\\u200a19\\u200a The company grew slowly until World War I, when Persia\\'s strategic importance led the British government to buy a controlling share in the company, essentially nationalizing British oil production in Iran.\\nThe British angered the Persians by intervening in their domestic affairs, including in the Persian Constitutional Revolution. Massive popular protests had forced Mozzafar al-Din Shah to allow for the Constitution of 1906, which limited his powers. It allowed for a democratically elected parliament Majlis to make the laws, and a prime minister to sign and carry them out. The prime minister would be appointed by the shah after a vote of confidence from Parliament. Nevertheless, the new constitution gave the shah many executive powers as well. It allowed for the shah to issue royal decrees (Farman), gave him the power to appoint and dismiss prime ministers (upon votes of confidence from Parliament), appoint half of the members of the Senate (which was not convened until 1949), and introduce bills to and even dissolve Parliament. It abolished arbitrary rule, but the shah served as an executive, rather than in a ceremonial role; consequently when a shah was weak, the government was more democratic, but when the shah acted on his own, the democratic aspects of the government could be sidelined. The contradictory aspects of this constitution would cause conflicts in the future. The Constitutional Revolution was opposed by the British and Russians, who attempted to subvert it through the backing of Mohammad Ali Shah Qajar (the son of Mozzafar-e-din Shah), who tried to break up the democratic government by force. A guerrilla movement led by Sattar Khan deposed him in 1910.In the aftermath of World War I there was widespread political dissatisfaction with the royalty terms of the British petroleum concession, under the Anglo-Persian Oil Company (APOC), whereby Persia received 16% of \"net profits\". In 1921, after years of severe mismanagement under the Qajar dynasty, a coup d\\'√©tat (allegedly backed by the British) brought a general, Reza Khan, into the government. By 1923, he had become prime minister, and gained a reputation as an effective politician with a lack of corruption. By 1925 under his influence, Parliament voted to remove Ahmad Shah Qajar from the throne, and Reza Khan was crowned Reza Shah Pahlavi, of the Pahlavi Dynasty. Reza Shah began a rapid and successful modernization program in Persia, which up until that point had been considered to be among the most impoverished countries in the world. Nevertheless, Reza Shah was also a very harsh ruler who did not tolerate dissent. By the 1930s, he had suppressed all opposition, and had sidelined the democratic aspects of the constitution. Opponents were jailed and in some cases even executed. While some agreed with his policies, arguing that it was necessary as Iran was in such turmoil, others argued that it was unjustified. One such opponent was a politician named Mohammad Mosaddegh, who was jailed in 1940. The experience gave him a lasting dislike for authoritarian rule and monarchy, and it helped make Mosaddegh a dedicated advocate of complete oil nationalization in Iran.Reza Shah attempted to attenuate the power of the colonial forces in Iran, and was successful to a large extent. However, he also needed them to help modernize the country. He did so by balancing the influence of various colonial powers, including that of Britain and Germany. In the 1930s, Reza Shah tried to terminate the APOC concession that the Qajar dynasty had granted, but Iran was still weak and Britain would not allow it. The concession was renegotiated on terms again favorable to the British (although the D\\'Arcy Concession was softened). On 21 March 1935, Reza Shah changed the name of the country from Persia to Iran. The Anglo-Persian Oil Company was then renamed the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (AIOC).In 1941, after the German invasion of the Soviet Union, British and Soviet forces invaded and occupied Iran, which was largely unopposed by the Iranian government and military. After World War II had broken out, Reza Shah had declared Iran\\'s neutrality, and attempted to appease the British, Soviets and Germans, all of whom maintained a degree of influence in Iran. The primary reasons behind the Anglo-Soviet invasion was to remove German influence in Iran and secure control over Iran\\'s oil fields and the Trans-Iranian Railway in order to deliver supplies to the USSR. Reza Shah was deposed and exiled by the British to South Africa, and his 22-year-old son Mohammad Reza Pahlavi was installed as the new Shah of Iran. Mohammad Reza Pahlavi was supported by the Allies because they viewed him as being less able to act against their interests in Iran. The new Shah, unlike his father, was initially a mild leader and at times indecisive. During the 1940s he did not for most part take an independent role in the government, and much of Reza Shah\\'s authoritarian policies were rolled back. Iranian democracy effectively was restored during this period as a result.The British occupational force withdrew from Iran after the end of the war. However, under Stalin, the Soviet Union partly remained by sponsoring two \"People\\'s Democratic Republics\" within Iran\\'s borders. The related conflict was ended when the US lobbied for the Iranian Army to reassert control over the two occupied territories. The earlier agreed-upon Soviet-Iranian oil agreement would never be honored. Nationalist leaders in Iran became influential by seeking a reduction in long-term foreign interventions in their country‚Äîespecially the oil concession which was very profitable for the West and not very profitable for Iran.\\nU.S. objectives in the Middle East remained the same between 1947 and 1952 but its strategy changed. Washington remained \"publicly in solidarity and privately at odds\" with Britain, its World War II ally. Britain\\'s empire was steadily weakening, and with an eye on international crises, the U.S. re-appraised its interests and the risks of being identified with British colonial interests. \"In Saudi Arabia, to Britain\\'s extreme disapproval, Washington endorsed the arrangement between ARAMCO and Saudi Arabia in the 50/50 accord that had reverberations throughout the region.\":\\u200a34‚Äì35\\u200aIran\\'s oil had been discovered and later controlled by the British-owned AIOC. Popular discontent with the AIOC began in the late 1940s: a large segment of Iran\\'s public and a number of politicians saw the company as exploitative and a central tool of continued British imperialism in Iran.:\\u200a59\\u200a\\n\\n\\n== Oil nationalization crisis ==\\n\\n\\n=== Assassination attempt on the Shah, and the appointment of Mosaddegh as Prime Minister ===\\nIn 1949, an assassin attempted to kill the Shah. Shocked by the experience and emboldened by public sympathy for his injury, the Shah began to take an increasingly active role in politics. He quickly organized the Iran Constituent Assembly to amend the constitution to increase his powers. He established the Senate of Iran, which had been a part of the Constitution of 1906 but had never been convened. The Shah had the right to appoint half the senators, and he chose men sympathetic to his aims. Mosaddegh thought this increase in the Shah\\'s political power was not democratic; he believed that the Shah should \"reign, but not rule\" in a manner similar to Europe\\'s constitutional monarchies. Led by Mosaddegh, political parties and opponents of the Shah\\'s policies banded together to form a coalition known as the National Front. Oil nationalization was a major policy goal for the party.\\nBy 1951, the National Front had won majority seats for the popularly elected Majlis (Parliament of Iran). According to Iran\\'s constitution, the majority elected party in the parliament would give a vote of confidence for its prime minister candidate, after which the Shah would appoint the candidate to power. The Prime Minister Haj Ali Razmara, who opposed the oil nationalization on technical grounds, was assassinated by the hardline Fadaiyan e-Islam (whose spiritual leader the Ayatollah Abol-Qassem Kashani, a mentor to the future Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, had been appointed Speaker of the Parliament by the National Front). After a vote of confidence from the National Front dominated Parliament, Mosaddegh was appointed prime minister of Iran by the Shah (replacing Hossein Ala, who had replaced Razmara). Under heavy pressure by the National Front, the assassin of Razmara (Khalil Tahmasebi) was released and pardoned, thus proving the movement\\'s power in Iranian politics. For the time being, Mosaddegh and Kashani were allies of convenience, as Mosaddegh saw that Kashani could mobilize the \"religious masses\", while Kashani wanted Mosaddegh to drive out British and other foreign influence.:\\u200a7\\u200a Kashani\\'s Fadaiyan mobs often violently attacked the opponents of nationalization and opponents of the National Front government, as well as \"immoral objects\", acting at times as unofficial \"enforcers\" for the movement. However, by late 1952 Mosaddegh was becoming increasingly opposed to Kashani, as the latter was contributing to mass political instability in Iran. Kashani in turn, berated Mosaddegh for not \"Islamizing\" Iran, as he was a firm believer in the separation of religion and state.:\\u200a76\\u200aThe Shah and his prime minister had an antagonistic relationship. Part of the problem stemmed from the fact that Mosaddegh was connected by blood to the former royal Qajar dynasty, and saw the Pahlavi king as a usurper to the throne. But the real issue stemmed from the fact that Mosaddegh represented a pro-democratic force that wanted to temper the Shah\\'s rule in Iranian politics. He wanted the Shah to be a ceremonial monarch rather than a ruling monarch, thus giving the elected government power over the un-elected Shah. While the constitution of Iran gave the Shah the power to rule directly, Mosaddegh used the united National Front bloc and the widespread popular support for the oil nationalization vote (the latter which the Shah supported as well) in order to block the Shah\\'s ability to act. As a result, the oil nationalization issue became increasingly intertwined with Mosaddegh\\'s pro-democracy movement. The dejected Shah was angered by Mosaddegh\\'s \"insolence\" (according to Abbas Milani, he angrily paced in the rooms of his palace at the thought that he would be reduced to a figurehead). But Mosaddegh and the oil nationalization\\'s popularity prevented the Shah from acting against his prime minister (which was allowed under Iran\\'s constitution, something that Mosaddegh felt a king had no right to do). In 1952 the Shah dismissed Mosaddegh, replacing him with Ahmad Qavam (a veteran prime minister). But widespread protests by Mosaddegh supporters resulted in the Shah immediately reinstating him.\\n\\n\\n=== Oil nationalization, the Abadan crisis, and rising tensions ===\\nIn late 1951, Iran\\'s Parliament in a near unanimous vote approved the oil nationalization agreement. The bill was widely popular among most Iranians, and generated a huge wave of nationalism, and immediately put Iran at loggerheads with Britain (the handful of MPs that disagreed with it voted for it as well in the face of overwhelming popular support, and the Fadaiyan\\'s wrath). The nationalization made Mosaddegh instantly popular among millions of Iranians, cementing him as a national hero, and placing him and Iran at the centre of worldwide attention.Britain now faced the newly elected nationalist government in Iran where Mosaddegh, with strong backing of the Iranian parliament and people, demanded more favorable concessionary arrangements, which Britain vigorously opposed.The U.S. State Department not only rejected Britain\\'s demand that it continue to be the primary beneficiary of Iranian oil reserves but \"U.S. international oil interests were among the beneficiaries of the concessionary arrangements that followed nationalization.\":\\u200a35\\u200aMohammad Mosaddegh attempted to negotiate with the AIOC, but the company rejected his proposed compromise. Mosaddegh\\'s plan, based on the 1948 compromise between the Venezuelan Government of R√≥mulo Gallegos and Creole Petroleum, would divide the profits from oil 50/50 between Iran and Britain. Against the recommendation of the United States, Britain refused this proposal and began planning to undermine and overthrow the Iranian government.In July 1951, the American diplomat Averell Harriman went to Iran to negotiate an Anglo-Iranian compromise, asking the Shah\\'s help; his reply was that \"in the face of public opinion, there was no way he could say a word against nationalisation\".:\\u200a106\\u200a Harriman held a press conference in Tehran, calling for reason and enthusiasm in confronting the \"nationalisation crisis\". As soon as he spoke, a journalist rose and shouted: \"We and the Iranian people all support Premier Mosaddegh and oil nationalisation!\" Everyone present began cheering and then marched out of the room; the abandoned Harriman shook his head in dismay.:\\u200a106\\u200aOn a visit to the United States in October 1951, Mosaddegh‚Äîin spite of the popularity of nationalization in Iran‚Äîagreed in talks with George C. McGhee to a complex settlement of the crisis involving the sale of the Abadan Refinery to a non-British company and Iranian control of the extraction of crude oil. The US waited until Winston Churchill became prime minister to present the deal, believing he would be more flexible, but the deal was rejected by the British.By September 1951, the British had virtually ceased Abadan oil field production, forbidden British export to Iran of key British commodities (including sugar and steel),:\\u200a110\\u200a and had frozen Iran\\'s hard currency accounts in British banks. British Prime Minister Clement Attlee considered seizing the Abadan Oil Refinery by force, but instead settled on an embargo by the Royal Navy, stopping any ship transporting Iranian oil for carrying so-called \"stolen property\". On his re-election as prime minister, Winston Churchill took an even harder stance against Iran.:\\u200a145\\u200aThe United Kingdom took its anti-nationalization case against Iran to the International Court of Justice at The Hague; PM Mosaddegh said the world would learn of a \"cruel and imperialistic country\" stealing from a \"needy and naked people\". The court ruled that it had no jurisdiction over the case. Nevertheless, the British continued to enforce the embargo of Iranian oil. In August 1952, Iranian Prime Minister Mosaddegh invited an American oil executive to visit Iran and the Truman administration welcomed the invitation. However, the suggestion upset Churchill, who insisted that the U.S. not undermine his campaign to isolate Mosaddegh because of British support for the U.S. in the Korean War.:\\u200a145\\u200aIn mid-1952, Britain\\'s embargo of Iranian oil was devastatingly effective. British agents in Tehran \"worked to subvert\" the government of Mosaddegh, who sought help from President Truman and then the World Bank but to no avail. \"Iranians were becoming poorer and unhappier by the day\" and Mosaddegh\\'s political coalition was fraying. To make matters worse, the Speaker of the Parliament Ayatollah Kashani, Mosaddegh\\'s main clerical supporter, became increasingly opposed to the Prime Minister, because Mosaddegh was squeezing him out of power. By 1953, he had completely turned on him, and supported the coup, depriving Mosaddegh of religious support, while giving it to the Shah.:\\u200a97\\u200aIn the Majlis election in the spring of 1952, Mosaddegh \"had little to fear from a free vote, since despite the country\\'s problems, he was widely admired as a hero. A free vote, however, was not what others were planning. British agents had fanned out across the country, bribing candidates, and the regional bosses who controlled them. Robert Zaehner alone spent over a ¬£1,500,000, smuggled in biscuit tins, to bribe Iranians, and later his colleague Norman Darbyshire admitted that the actual coup cost the British government a further ¬£700,000. They hoped to fill the Majlis with deputies who would vote to depose Mosaddegh. It would be a coup carried out by seemingly legal means.\":\\u200a135\\u200aWhile the National Front, which often supported Mosaddegh won handily in the big cities, there was no one to monitor voting in the rural areas. Violence broke out in Abadan and other parts of the country where elections were hotly contested. Faced with having to leave Iran for The Hague where Britain was suing for control of Iranian oil, Mosaddegh\\'s cabinet voted to postpone the remainder of the election until after the return of the Iranian delegation from The Hague::\\u200a136‚Äì137\\u200a\\nWhile Mosaddegh dealt with political challenge, he faced another that most Iranians considered far more urgent. The British blockade of Iranian seaports meant that Iran was left without access to markets where it could sell its oil. The embargo had the effect of causing Iran to spiral into bankruptcy. Tens of thousands had lost their jobs at the Abadan refinery, and although most understood and passionately supported the idea of nationalisation, they naturally hoped that Mosaddegh would find a way to put them back to work. The only way he could do that was to sell oil.:\\u200a136‚Äì137\\u200a\\nTo make matters worse, the Communist Tudeh Party, which supported the Soviet Union and had attempted to kill the Shah only four years earlier, began to infiltrate the military and send mobs to \"support Mosaddegh\" (but in reality to marginalize all non-Communist opponents). Earlier, the Tudeh had denounced Mosaddegh, but by 1953 they changed tack and decided to \"support\" him. The Tudeh violently attacked opponents under the guise of helping the prime minister (the cousin of the future queen of Iran, Farah Pahlavi, was stabbed at the age of 13 in his school by Tudeh activists), and unwittingly helped cause Mosaddegh\\'s reputation to decline, despite the fact that he never officially endorsed them. However, by 1953 he and the Tudeh had formed an unofficial alliance of convenience with each other; the Tudeh were the \"foot soldiers\" for his government, effectively replacing the Fadaiyan in that role, all the while secretly hoping that Mosaddegh would institute communism. Pro-Shah mobs also carried out attacks on Mosaddegh opponents, and there may have been some CIA coordination.Worried about Britain\\'s other interests in Iran, and (thanks to the Tudeh party) believing that Iran\\'s nationalism was really a Soviet-backed plot, Britain persuaded US Secretary of State John Foster Dulles that Iran was falling to the Soviets‚Äîeffectively exploiting the American Cold War mindset. Since President Harry S. Truman was busy fighting a war in Korea, he did not agree to overthrow the government of Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh. However, in 1953, when Dwight D. Eisenhower became president, the UK convinced the U.S. to undertake a joint coup d\\'√©tat.:\\u200a82\\u200a\\n\\n\\n=== Final months of Mosaddegh\\'s government ===\\nBy 1953, economic tensions caused by the British embargo and political turmoil began to take a major toll on Mosaddegh\\'s popularity and political power. He was increasingly blamed for the economic and political crisis. Political violence was becoming widespread in the form of street clashes between rival political groups. Mosaddegh was losing popularity and support among the working class which had been his strongest supporters. As he lost support, he became more autocratic. As early as August 1952, he began to rely on emergency powers to rule, generating controversy among his supporters. After an assassination attempt upon one of his cabinet ministers and himself, he ordered the jailing of dozens of his political opponents. This act created widespread anger among the general public, and led to accusations that Mosaddegh was becoming a dictator. The Tudeh party\\'s unofficial alliance with Mosaddegh led to fears of communism, and increasingly it was the communists who were taking part in pro-Mosaddegh rallies and attacking opponents.By mid-1953 a mass of resignations by Mosaddegh\\'s parliamentary supporters reduced the National Front seats in Parliament. A referendum to dissolve parliament and give the prime minister power to make law was submitted to voters, and it passed with 99.9 percent approval, 2,043,300 votes to 1300 votes against.:\\u200a274\\u200a The referendum was widely seen by opponents as treason and an act against the Shah, who was stripped of military power and control over national resources. This act would be one of many key factors in a chain of events leading to Mosaddegh\\'s deposition.The Shah himself initially opposed the coup plans and supported the oil nationalization, but he joined in after being informed by the CIA that he too would be \"deposed\" if he didn\\'t play along. The experience left him with a lifelong awe of American power and would contribute to his pro-US policies while generating a hatred of the British. Mosaddegh\\'s decision to dissolve Parliament also contributed to his decision.\\n\\n\\n== Execution of Operation Ajax ==\\nThe official pretext for the start of the coup was Mosaddegh\\'s decree to dissolve Parliament, giving himself and his cabinet complete power to rule, while effectively stripping the Shah of his powers. It resulted in him being accused of giving himself \"total and dictatorial powers.\" The Shah, who had been resisting the CIA\\'s demands for the coup, finally agreed to support it.\\nHaving obtained the Shah\\'s concurrence, the CIA executed the coup. Firmans (royal decrees) dismissing Mosaddegh and appointing General Fazlollah Zahedi (a loyalist who had helped Reza Shah reunify Iran decades earlier) were drawn up by the coup plotters and signed by the Shah. Having signed the decrees and delivered them to General Zahedi, he and Queen Soraya departed for a week-long vacation in northern Iran. On Saturday 15 August, Colonel Nematollah Nassiri, the commander of the Imperial Guard, delivered to Mosaddegh a firman from the Shah dismissing him. Mosaddegh, who had been warned of the plot, probably by the Communist Tudeh Party, rejected the firman and had Nassiri arrested. Mosaddegh argued at his trial after the coup that under the Iranian constitutional monarchy, the Shah had no constitutional right to issue an order for the elected Prime Minister\\'s dismissal without Parliament\\'s consent. However, the constitution at the time did allow for such an action, which Mosaddegh considered unfair. The action was publicized within Iran by the CIA and in the United States by The New York Times. Mosaddegh\\'s supporters took to the streets in violent protests. Following the failed coup attempt, the Shah, accompanied by his second wife Soraya Esfandiary-Bakhtiari and Aboul Fath Atabay fled to Baghdad. Arriving unannounced, the Shah asked for permission for himself and his consort to stay in Baghdad for a few days before continuing on to Europe. After high-level Government consultations, they were escorted to the White House, the Iraqi Government\\'s guest house, before flying to Italy in a plane flown by Mohammad Amir Khatami.After the first coup attempt failed, General Zahedi, declaring that he was the rightful prime minister of Iran, shuttled between multiple safe houses attempting to avoid arrest. Mosaddegh ordered security forces to capture the coup plotters, and dozens were imprisoned. Believing that he had succeeded, and that he was in full control of the government, Mosaddegh erred. Assuming that the coup had failed, he asked his supporters to return to their homes and to continue with their lives as normal. The Tudeh party members also returned to their homes, no longer carrying out enforcement duties. The CIA was ordered to leave Iran, although Kermit Roosevelt Jr. was slow to receive the message‚Äîallegedly due to MI6 interference‚Äîand eagerly continued to foment anti-Mosaddegh unrest. The Eisenhower administration considered changing its policy to support Mosaddegh, with undersecretary of state Walter Bedell Smith remarking on 17 August: \"Whatever his faults, Mosaddegh had no love for the Russians and timely aid might enable him to keep Communism in check.\"\\nGeneral Zahedi, who was still on the run, met with the pro-Shah Ayatollah Mohammad Behbahani and other Shah supporters in secret. There (using CIA money deridingly known as \"Behbahani dollars\"), they quickly created a new plan. Already, much of the country\\'s upper class was in shock from the Shah\\'s flight from Iran, fears of communism, and Mosaddegh\\'s arrests of opponents. They capitalized on this sentiment in their plans. The Ayatollah Behbahani also used his influence to rally religious demonstrators against Mosaddegh.On 19 August, hired infiltrators posing as Tudeh party members began to organize a \"communist revolution\". They came and encouraged real Tudeh members to join in. Soon, the Tudeh members took to the streets attacking virtually any symbols of capitalism, and looting private businesses and destroying shops. Much of southern Tehran\\'s business district, including the bazaars, were vandalized. With sudden mass public revulsion against this act, the next part of Zahedi\\'s plan came into action. From the vandalized bazaars, a second group of paid infiltrators, this time posing as Shah supporters, organized angry crowds of common Iranians who were terrified about a \"communist revolution\" and sickened by the violence.The CIA hired the two biggest gangsters of the South Tehran ghetto,  \"Icy Ramadan\" and Shaban Jafari A.K.A \"Brainless Shaban\", to mobilize protest against Mosaddegh.By the middle of the day, large crowds of regular citizens, armed with improvised weapons, took to the streets in mass demonstrations, and beat back the Tudeh party members. Under Zahedi\\'s authority, the army left its barracks and drove off the communist Tudeh and then stormed all government buildings with the support of demonstrators. Mosaddegh fled after a tank fired a single shell into his house, but he later turned himself in to the army\\'s custody. To prevent further bloodshed, he refused a last attempt to organize his supporters. By the end of the day, Zahedi and the army were in control of the government. Despite the CIA\\'s role in creating the conditions for the coup, there is little evidence to suggest that Kermit Roosevelt Jr. or other CIA officials were directly responsible for the actions of the demonstrators or the army on 19 August. It has even been suggested that Roosevelt\\'s activities between 15 and 19 August were primarily intended to organize \"stay-behind networks as part of the planned CIA evacuation of the country\", although they allowed him to later \"claim responsibility for the day\\'s outcome.\"  In 2014, historian Ray Takeyh conclusively showed that the US-led coup attempt was unsuccessful, with the CIA writing to Eisenhower that \"The move failed [‚Ä¶] We now [...] probably have to snuggle up to Mosaddeq if we\\'re going to save [our influence in Iran];\" the demonstrations that led to Mosaddeq\\'s resignation took place some weeks after the Roosevelt-organized ones, and were composed of average citizens, not the thugs-for-hire that the CIA and MI6 had recruited.The Shah stayed in a hotel in Italy until he learned what had transpired, upon which he \"chokingly declared\": \"I knew they loved me.\" Allen Dulles, the director of the CIA, flew back with the Shah from Rome to Tehran. Zahedi officially replaced Mosaddegh. Mosaddegh was arrested, tried, and originally sentenced to death. But on the Shah\\'s personal orders, his sentence was commuted to three years\\' solitary confinement in a military prison, followed by house arrest until his death.\\n\\n\\n== United States\\' role ==\\nAs a condition for restoring the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, in 1954 the US required removal of the AIOC\\'s monopoly; five American petroleum companies, Royal Dutch Shell, and the Compagnie Fran√ßaise des P√©troles, were to draw Iran\\'s petroleum after the successful coup d\\'√©tat‚ÄîOperation Ajax. The Shah declared this to be a \"victory\" for Iranians, with the massive influx of money from this agreement resolving the economic collapse from the last three years, and allowing him to carry out his planned modernization projects.As part of that, the CIA organized anti-Communist guerrillas to fight the Tudeh Party if they seized power in the chaos of Operation Ajax. Released National Security Archive documents showed that Undersecretary of State Walter Bedell Smith reported that the CIA had agreed with Qashqai tribal leaders, in south Iran, to establish a clandestine safe haven from which U.S.-funded guerrillas and spies could operate.The CIA sent Major General Norman Schwarzkopf Sr. to persuade the exiled Shah to return to rule Iran. Schwarzkopf trained the security forces that would become known as SAVAK to secure the shah\\'s hold on power.According to a heavily redacted CIA document released to the National Security Archive in response to a Freedom of Information request, \"Available documents do not indicate who authorized CIA to begin planning the operation, but it almost certainly was President Eisenhower himself. Eisenhower biographer Stephen Ambrose has written that the absence of documentation reflected the President\\'s style.\"\\n\\nThe CIA document then quotes from the Ambrose biography of Eisenhower: Before going into the operation, Ajax had to have the approval of the President. Eisenhower participated in none of the meetings that set up Ajax; he received only oral reports on the plan; and he did not discuss it with his Cabinet or the NSC. Establishing a pattern he would hold to throughout his Presidency, he kept his distance and left no documents behind that could implicate the President in any projected coup. But in the privacy of the Oval Office, over cocktails, he was kept informed by Foster Dulles, and he maintained a tight control over the activities of the CIA.\\nOne version of the CIA history, written by Wilber, referred to the operation as TPAJAX.A tactic Roosevelt admitted to using was bribing demonstrators into attacking symbols of the Shah, while chanting pro-Mosaddegh slogans. As king, the Shah was largely seen as a symbol of Iran at the time by many Iranians and monarchists. Roosevelt declared that the more that these agents showed their hate for the Shah and attacked his symbols, the more it caused the average Iranian citizen to dislike and distrust Mosaddegh.\\nThe British and American spy agencies strengthened the monarchy in Iran by backing the pro-western Shah for the next 26 years. The Shah was overthrown in 1979. The overthrow of Iran\\'s elected government in 1953 ensured Western control of Iran\\'s petroleum resources and prevented the Soviet Union from competing for Iranian oil. Some Iranian clerics cooperated with the western spy agencies because they were dissatisfied with Mosaddegh\\'s secular government.\\nWhile the broad outlines of the operation are known, \"...the C.I.A.\\'s records were widely thought by historians to have the potential to add depth and clarity to a famous but little-documented intelligence operation\", reporter Tim Weiner wrote in The New York Times 29 May 1997.\"The Central Intelligence Agency, which has repeatedly pledged for more than five years to make public the files from its secret mission to overthrow the government of Iran in 1953, said today that it had destroyed or lost almost all the documents decades ago.\"\\nA historian who was a member of the CIA staff in 1992 and 1993 said in an interview today that the records were obliterated by \"a culture of destruction\" at the agency. The historian, Nick Cullather, said he believed that records on other major cold war covert operations had been burned, including those on secret missions in Indonesia in the 1950s and a successful CIA-sponsored coup in Guyana in the early 1960s. \"Iran‚Äîthere\\'s nothing\", Mr. Cullather said. \"Indonesia‚Äîvery little. Guyana‚Äîthat was burned.\"\\nDonald Wilber, one of the CIA officers who planned the 1953 coup in Iran, wrote an account titled, Clandestine Service History Overthrow of Premier Mossadeq of Iran: November 1952 ‚Äì August 1953. Wilber said one goal of the coup was to strengthen the Shah.\\nIn 2000, James Risen at The New York Times obtained the previously secret CIA version of the coup written by Wilber and summarized its contents, which includes the following:\\n\\nIn early August, the CIA increased the pressure. Iranian operatives pretending to be Communists threatened Muslim leaders with \"savage punishment if they opposed Mossadegh\", seeking to stir anti-Communist sentiment in the religious community.\\nIn addition, the secret history says, the house of at least one prominent Muslim was bombed by CIA agents posing as Communists. It does not say whether anyone was hurt in this attack.\\nThe agency was intensifying its propaganda campaign. A leading newspaper owner was granted a personal loan of about $45,000, \"in the belief that this would make his organ amenable to our purposes.\"\\n\\nThe Shah remained intransigent. In a 1 August meeting with General Norman Schwarzkopf, he refused to sign the C.I.A.-written decrees firing Mr. Mossadegh and appointing General Zahedi. He said he doubted that the army would support him in a showdown.\\nThe National Security Archive at George Washington University contains the full account by Wilber, along with many other coup-related documents and analysis.In a January 1973 telephone conversation made public in 2009, US President Richard Nixon told CIA Director Richard Helms, who was awaiting Senate confirmation to become the new U.S. Ambassador to Iran, that Nixon wanted Helms to be a \"regional ambassador\" to Persian Gulf oil states, and noted that Helms had been a schoolmate of Shah Reza Pahlavi.\\n\\n\\n=== Release of U.S. government records and official acknowledgement ===\\nIn August 2013, on the 60th anniversary of the coup, the US government released documents showing they were involved in staging the coup. The documents also describe the motivations behind the coup and the strategies used to stage it. The UK had sought to censor information regarding its role in the coup; a significant number of documents about the coup remained classified. The release of the declassified documents, which marked the first US official acknowledgement of its role, was seen as a goodwill gesture on the part of the Obama administration. According to Aljazeera, the deputy director of the National Security Archive, Malcolm Byrne, disclosed that the CIA documented the secret histories purposely for official use.Public awareness of American and British participation in Mosaddeq\\'s overthrow was long-standing. An internal narrative from the middle of the 1970s called \"The Battle for Iran\" makes a clear reference to the CIA\\'s involvement. In 1981, the agency made a highly edited version of the report public in reaction to an ACLU lawsuit, but it blocked out all mentions of TPAJAX, the code name for the American-led operation. These references can be found in the most recent release in 2013, which is thought to be the CIA\\'s first official admission that the agency assisted in the coup\\'s planning and execution.In June 2017, the United States State Department\\'s Office of the Historian released its revised historical account of the event. The volume of historical records \"focuses on the evolution of U.S. thinking on Iran as well as the U.S. Government covert operation that resulted in Mosadeq\\'s overthrow on 19 August 1953\". Though some of the relevant records were destroyed long ago, the release contains a collection of roughly 1,000 pages, only a small number of which remain classified. One revelation is that the CIA \"attempted to call off the failing coup but was salvaged by an insubordinate spy.\" The reports released by the U.S. had reached 1,007 pages, consisting of diplomatic cables and letters according to VOA News.In March 2018, the National Security Archive released a declassified British memo alleging that the United States Embassy sent \"large sums of money\" to \"influential people\"‚Äînamely senior Iranian clerics‚Äîin the days leading up to Mosaddeq\\'s overthrow. According to the Guardian, despite the U.S. showing regrets about the coup, it has failed to officially issue an apology over its involvement.\\n\\n\\n=== United States financial support ===\\nThe CIA paid a large sum to carry out the operation. Depending on the expenses to be counted, the final cost is estimated to vary from $100,000 to $20 million. CIA gave Zahedi\\'s government $5 million after the coup with Zahedi himself receiving an extra million.\\n\\n\\n=== United States motives ===\\nHistorians disagree on what motivated the United States to change its policy towards Iran and stage the coup. Middle East historian Ervand Abrahamian identified the coup d\\'√©tat as \"a classic case of nationalism clashing with imperialism in the Third World\". He states that Secretary of State Dean Acheson admitted the \"\\'Communist threat\\' was a smokescreen\" in responding to President Eisenhower\\'s claim that the Tudeh party was about to assume power:\\n Throughout the crisis, the \"communist danger\" was more of a rhetorical device than a real issue‚Äîi.e. it was part of the cold-war discourse ...The Tudeh was no match for the armed tribes and the 129,000-man military. What is more, the British and Americans had enough inside information to be confident that the party had no plans to initiate armed insurrection. At the beginning of the crisis, when the Truman administration was under the impression a compromise was possible, Acheson had stressed the communist danger, and warned if Mosaddegh was not helped, the Tudeh would take over. The (British) Foreign Office had retorted that the Tudeh was no real threat. But, in August 1953, when the Foreign Office echoed the Eisenhower administration\\'s claim that the Tudeh was about to take over, Acheson now retorted that there was no such communist danger. Acheson was honest enough to admit that the issue of the Tudeh was a smokescreen.\\nAbrahamian states that Iran\\'s oil was the central focus of the coup, for both the British and the Americans, though \"much of the discourse at the time linked it to the Cold War\". Abrahamian wrote, \"If Mosaddegh had succeeded in nationalizing the British oil industry in Iran, that would have set an example and was seen at that time by the Americans as a threat to U.S. oil interests throughout the world, because other countries would do the same.\" Mosaddegh did not want any compromise solution that allowed a degree of foreign control. Abrahamian said that Mosaddegh \"wanted real nationalization, both in theory and practice\".\\nTirman points out that agricultural land owners were politically dominant in Iran well into the 1960s, and the monarch Reza Shah\\'s aggressive land expropriation policies‚Äîto the benefit of himself and his supporters‚Äîresulted in the Iranian government being Iran\\'s largest land owner. \"The landlords and oil producers had new backing, moreover, as American interests were for the first time exerted in Iran. The Cold War was starting, and Soviet challenges were seen in every leftist movement. But the reformers were at root nationalists, not communists, and the issue that galvanized them above all others was the control of oil.\" The belief that oil was the central motivator behind the coup has been echoed in the popular media by authors such as Robert Byrd, Alan Greenspan, and Ted Koppel.Middle East political scientist Mark Gasiorowski states that while, on the face of it, there is considerable merit to the argument that U.S. policymakers helped U.S. oil companies gain a share in Iranian oil production after the coup, \"it seems more plausible to argue that U.S. policymakers were motivated mainly by fears of a communist takeover in Iran, and that the involvement of U.S. companies was sought mainly to prevent this from occurring. The Cold War was at its height in the early 1950s, and the Soviet Union was viewed as an expansionist power seeking world domination. Eisenhower had made the Soviet threat a key issue in the 1952 elections, accusing the Democrats of being soft on communism and of having \\'lost China.\\' Once in power, the new administration quickly sought to put its views into practice.\"A 2019 study by Gasiorowski concluded \"that U.S. policymakers did not have compelling evidence that the threat of a Communist takeover was increasing substantially in the months before the coup. Rather, the Eisenhower administration interpreted the available evidence in a more alarming manner than the Truman administration had.\"Gasiorowski further states \"the major U.S. oil companies were not interested in Iran at this time. A glut existed in the world oil market. The U.S. majors had increased their production in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait in 1951 in order to make up for the loss of Iranian production; operating in Iran would force them to cut back production in these countries which would create tensions with Saudi and Kuwaiti leaders. Furthermore, if nationalist sentiments remained high in Iran, production there would be risky. U.S. oil companies had shown no interest in Iran in 1951 and 1952. By late 1952, the Truman administration had come to believe that participation by U.S. companies in the production of Iranian oil was essential to maintain stability in Iran and keep Iran out of Soviet hands. In order to gain the participation of the major U.S. oil companies, Truman offered to scale back a large anti-trust case then being brought against them. The Eisenhower administration shared Truman\\'s views on the participation of U.S. companies in Iran and also agreed to scale back the anti-trust case. Thus, not only did U.S. majors not want to participate in Iran at this time, it took a major effort by U.S. policymakers to persuade them to become involved.\"In 2004, Gasiorowski edited a book on the coup arguing that \"the climate of intense cold war rivalry between the superpowers, together with Iran\\'s strategic vital location between the Soviet Union and the Persian Gulf oil fields, led U.S. officials to believe that they had to take whatever steps were necessary to prevent Iran from falling into Soviet hands.\" While \"these concerns seem vastly overblown today\" the pattern of \"the 1945‚Äì46 Azerbaijan crisis, the consolidation of Soviet control in Eastern Europe, the communist triumph in China, and the Korean War‚Äîand with the Red Scare at its height in the United States\" would not allow U.S. officials to risk allowing the Tudeh Party to gain power in Iran. Furthermore, \"U.S. officials believed that resolving the oil dispute was essential for restoring stability in Iran, and after March 1953 it appeared that the dispute could be resolved only at the expense either of Britain or of Mosaddeq.\" He concludes \"it was geostrategic considerations, rather than a desire to destroy Mosaddeq\\'s movement, to establish a dictatorship in Iran or to gain control over Iran\\'s oil, that persuaded U.S. officials to undertake the coup.\" Faced with choosing between British interests and Iran, the U.S. chose Britain, Gasiorowski said. \"Britain was the closest ally of the United States, and the two countries were working as partners on a wide range of vitally important matters throughout the world at this time. Preserving this close relationship was more important to U.S. officials than saving Mosaddeq\\'s tottering regime.\" A year earlier, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill used Britain\\'s support for the U.S. in the Cold War to insist the United States not undermine his campaign to isolate Mosaddegh. \"Britain was supporting the Americans in Korea, he reminded Truman, and had a right to expect \\'Anglo-American unity\\' on Iran.\":\\u200a145\\u200aAccording to Kinzer, for most Americans, the crisis in Iran became just part of the conflict between Communism and \"the Free world\".:\\u200a84\\u200a \"A great sense of fear, particularly the fear of encirclement, shaped American consciousness during this period. ... Soviet power had already subdued Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia. Communist governments were imposed on Bulgaria and Romania in 1946, Hungary and Poland in 1947, and Czechoslovakia in 1948. Albania and Yugoslavia also turned to communism. Greek communists made a violent bid for power. Soviet soldiers blocked land routes to Berlin for sixteen months. In 1949, the Soviet Union successfully tested a nuclear weapon. That same year, pro-Western forces in China lost their Civil War to communists led by Mao Zedong. From Washington, it seemed that enemies were on the march everywhere.\":\\u200a84\\u200a Consequently, \"the United States, challenged by what most Americans saw as a relentless communist advance, slowly ceased to view Iran as a country with a unique history that faced a unique political challenge.\":\\u200a205\\u200a Some historians, including Douglas Little, Abbas Milani and George Lenczowski have echoed the view that fears of a communist takeover or Soviet influence motivated the U.S. to intervene.\\nOn 11 May 1951, prior to the overthrow of Mosaddegh, Adolf A. Berle warned the U.S. State Department that U.S. \"control of the Middle East was at stake, which, with its Persian Gulf oil, meant \\'substantial control of the world.\\'\"\\n\\n\\n=== News coverage in the United States and the United Kingdom ===\\nWhen Mosaddegh called for the dissolution of the Majlis in August 1953, the editors of the New York Times gave the opinion that: \"A plebiscite more fantastic and farcical than any ever held under Hitler or Stalin is now being staged in Iran by Premier Mosaddegh in an effort to make himself unchallenged dictator of the country.\"A year after the coup, the New York Times wrote on 6 August 1954, that a new oil \"agreement between Iran and a consortium of foreign oil companies\" was \"good news indeed\":\\nCostly as the dispute over Iranian oil has been to all concerned, the affair may yet be proved worthwhile if lessons are learned from it: Underdeveloped countries with rich resources now have an object lesson in the heavy cost that must be paid by one of their number which goes berserk with fanatical nationalism. It is perhaps too much to hope that Iran\\'s experience will prevent the rise of Mossadeghs in other countries, but that experience may at least strengthen the hands of more reasonable and more far-seeing leaders. In some circles in Great Britain the charge will be pushed that American \"imperialism\"‚Äîin the shape of the American oil firms in the consortium!‚Äîhas once again elbowed Britain from a historic stronghold.\\nThe documentary Cinematograph aired on 18 August 2011 on the anniversary of the coup. In it, BBC admitted for the first time to the role of BBC Persian radio as the propaganda arm of the British government in Iran. The Cinematograph narrator said:\\n\\nThe British government used the BBC Persian radio for advancing its propaganda against Mosaddegh and anti-Mosaddegh material were repeatedly aired on the radio channel to the extent that Iranian staff at the BBC Persian radio went on strike to protest the move.\\nThe documentary quoted a 21 July 1951 classified document in which a Foreign Office official thanked the British ambassador for his proposals that were precisely followed by the BBC Persian radio to strengthen its propaganda against Mosaddegh:\\n\\nThe BBC had already made most of the points which you listed, but they were very glad to have an indication from you of what was likely to be most effective and will arrange their programme accordingly... We should also avoid direct attacks on the \\'ruling classes\\' since it seems probable that we may want to deal with a government drawn from those classes should Mosaddegh fall.The BBC was at times even used directly in the operations, sending coded messages to the coup plotters by changing the wording of its broadcasts.An early account of the CIA\\'s role in the coup appeared in The Saturday Evening Post in late 1954, purporting to explain how \"the strategic little nation of Iran was rescued from the closing clutch of Moscow.\" The report was approved by the CIA, and its authors may have been assisted by Kermit Roosevelt Jr., who had written for the Post before.\\n\\n\\n== Britain\\'s role ==\\nDespite the British government\\'s pressure, the National Security Archive released two declassified documents in August 2017 which confirm the British solicitation of the United States\\' assistance in ousting Mosaddegh. According to these records, the British first approached the American government about a plan for the coup in November 1952 \"repeatedly\" asking U.S. to join the coup, claiming that the Mosaddegh government would be ineffective in preventing a communist takeover, and that Mosaddegh was a threat to America\\'s global fight against communism, which they believed necessitated action; the records also state that UK and U.S. spy agencies had by then had \"very tentative and preliminary discussions regarding the practicability of such a move\". At the time, the American government was already preparing to aid Mosaddegh in his oil dealings with the British, and believed him to be anti-communist‚Äîconsiderations which made the U.S. government skeptical of the plot. Since President Truman\\'s term was drawing to a close in January 1953, and there was too much uncertainty and danger associated with the plot, the U.S. government decided not to take action against Mosaddegh at the time.According to the 1952 documents, it was Christopher Steel, the No 2 official in the British embassy in Washington, who \"pitched\" the idea of the coup to US officials amid the US-Britain talks which had begun in October. The document also says that the British officials rejected Paul Nitze\\'s suggestion that, instead of executing a coup, they mount a \"campaign\" against Ayatollah Abolqasem Kashani, \"a leading opponent of British involvement in Iran\\'s oil industry\", and the communist Tudeh Party. They \"pressed US for a decision\" since they knew \"the Truman administration was in its final weeks\". According to Wilber, the British Secret Intelligence Service worked with CIA to form a propaganda campaign via \"the press, handbills and the Tehran clergy\" to \"weaken the Mossadeq government in any way possible\".More broadly, the oil nationalization law led to a direct conflict of interests between Mosaddegh and the British government, and the latter internally proposed to regain its control over the oil industry in Iran by following a \"three-track strategy\" aimed at either \"pressuring him into a favorable settlement or by removing him from the office.\" The three components of Britain strategy consisted of (1) refusing direct negotiation with Mosaddegh, (2) imposing economic sanctions on Iran and performing war games in the region, and (3) the removal of Mosaddegh through \"covert political action\".In the lead-up to the 70th anniversary of the coup in August 2023, David Owen, who was the UK Foreign Secretary in the late 1970s, said that MI6 should follow the example of the CIA and acknowledge its role in the coup.\\n\\n\\n== The role of the clergy ==\\nMosaddegh appointed a series of secular ministers to his cabinet during his premiership, losing his support with the clergy. In 1953, Ayatollah Abol-Qasem Kashani and his followers organised a series of protests against Mosaddegh\\'s liberal reforms ‚Äì such as the extension of the vote to women. By July 1953 when Mosaddegh asked for a critical extension of his emergency powers, \"... Clerical members of the Majles who supported Kashani left the National Front Coalition and set up their own Islamic Faction...\". (Muslim Warriors). This faction then  boycotted the 1953 referendum about the dissolution of parliament.At 8am on 18 August Ayatollah Behbahan mobilised 3000 stick and club wielding anti-shah protestors formed a mob in Tehran. This was done in the hope that the removal of Mosaddegh would create a more religious government. Separate mobilisation was instigated by Ayatollah Kashani in the country at this time. There has been documentation that both Ayatollah Behbahani and Kashani received funds from the CIA by some sources. The former\\'s mob would lead Mosaddegh to abandon his residence, and ultimately his capture. Iranian Historian Michael Axworthy stated that \"... [The clergy\\'s] move to oppose Mossadeq was the decisive factor in his downfall...\".\\n\\n\\n== Aftermath ==\\nThe coup has been said to have \"left a profound and long-lasting legacy.\":\\u200a122\\u200a\\n\\n\\n=== Blowback ===\\nThe coup caused long-lasting damage to the U.S. reputation, according to documents released to the National Security Archive and reflected in the book Mohammad Mosaddeq and the 1953 Coup in Iran:\\n\\nThe \\'28 Mordad\\' coup, as it is known by its Persian date [in the Solar Hijri calendar], was a watershed for Iran, for the Middle East and for the standing of the United States in the region. The joint US-British operation ended Iran\\'s drive to assert sovereign control over its own resources and helped put an end to a vibrant chapter in the history of the country\\'s nationalist and democratic movements. These consequences resonated with dramatic effect in later years. When the Shah finally fell in 1979, memories of the US intervention in 1953, which made possible the monarch\\'s subsequent, and increasingly unpopular, 25-year reign intensified the anti-American character of the revolution in the minds of many Iranians.\\nThe authoritarian monarch appreciated the coup, Kermit Roosevelt wrote in his account of the affair. \"\\'I owe my throne to God, my people, my army and to you!\\' By \\'you\\' he [the shah] meant me and the two countries‚ÄîGreat Britain and the United States‚ÄîI was representing. We were all heroes.\"On 16 June 2000, The New York Times published the secret CIA report, \"Clandestine Service History, Overthrow of Premier Mossadeq of Iran, November 1952 ‚Äì August 1953\", partly explaining the coup from CIA agent Wilber\\'s perspective. In a related story, The New York Times reporter James Risen penned a story revealing that Wilber\\'s report, hidden for nearly five decades, had recently come to light.\\nIn the summer of 2001, Ervand Abrahamian writes in the journal Science & Society that Wilber\\'s version of the coup was missing key information some of which was available elsewhere:\\n\\n The New York Times recently leaked a CIA report on the 1953 American-British overthrow of Mosaddeq, Iran\\'s Prime Minister. It billed the report as a secret history of the secret coup, and treated it as an invaluable substitute for the U.S. files that remain inaccessible. But a reconstruction of the coup from other sources, especially from the archives of the British Foreign Office, indicates that this report is highly sanitized. It glosses over such sensitive issues as the crucial participation of the U.S. ambassador in the actual overthrow; the role of U.S. military advisers; the harnessing of local Nazis and Muslim terrorists; and the use of assassinations to destabilize the government. What is more, it places the coup in the context of the Cold War rather than that of the Anglo-Iranian oil crisis‚Äîa classic case of nationalism clashing with imperialism in the Third World.\\nIn a review of Tim Weiner\\'s Legacy of Ashes, historian Michael Beschloss wrote, \"Mr. Weiner argues that a bad C.I.A. track record has encouraged many of our gravest contemporary problems... A generation of Iranians grew up knowing that the C.I.A. had installed the shah\", Mr. Weiner notes. \"In time, the chaos that the agency had created in the streets of Tehran would return to haunt the United States.\"The administration of Dwight D. Eisenhower considered the coup a success, but, given its blowback, that opinion is no longer generally held, because of its \"haunting and terrible legacy\".:\\u200a215\\u200a In 2000, Madeleine Albright, U.S. Secretary of State, said that intervention by the U.S. in the internal affairs of Iran was a setback for democratic government. The coup is widely believed to have significantly contributed to the 1979 Iranian Revolution, which deposed the \"pro-Western\" Shah and replaced the monarchy with an \"anti-Western\" Islamic republic.\"For many Iranians, the coup demonstrated duplicity by the United States, which presented itself as a defender of freedom but did not hesitate to use underhanded methods to overthrow a democratically elected government to suit its own economic and strategic interests\", the Agence France-Presse reported.United States Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas, who visited Iran both before and after the coup, wrote that \"When Mosaddegh and Persia started basic reforms, we became alarmed. We united with the British to destroy him; we succeeded; and ever since, our name has not been an honored one in the Middle East.\"\\n\\n\\n=== Iran ===\\n\\n\\n==== Perceptions of the Shah ====\\nWhen the Shah returned to Iran after the coup, he was greeted by a cheering crowd. He wrote in his memoirs that while he had been a king for over a decade, for the first time he felt that the people had \"elected\" and \"approved\" of him, and that he had a \"legitimate\" popular mandate to carry out his reforms (although some in the crowd may have been bribed). The Shah was never able to remove the reputation of being a \"foreign imposed\" ruler among non-royalist Iranians. The Shah throughout his rule continued to assume that he was supported by virtually everybody in Iran, and sank into deep dejection when in 1978 massive mobs demanded his ouster. The incident left him in awe of American power, while it also gave him a deep hatred of the British.\\n\\n\\n==== Bloody suppression of the opposition ====\\nAn immediate consequence of the coup d\\'√©tat was the Shah\\'s suppression of all republicanist political dissent, especially the liberal and nationalist opposition umbrella group National Front as well as the (Communist) Tudeh party, and concentration of political power in the Shah and his courtiers.The minister of Foreign Affairs and the closest associate of Mosaddegh, Hossein Fatemi, was executed by order of the Shah\\'s military court by firing squad on 10 November 1954. According to Kinzer, \"The triumphant Shah [Pahlavi] ordered the execution of several dozen military officers and student leaders who had been closely associated with Mohammad Mosaddegh\".As part of the post-coup d\\'√©tat political repression between 1953 and 1958, the Shah outlawed the National Front, and arrested most of its leaders. The Shah personally spared Mosaddegh the death penalty, and he was given 3 years in prison, followed by house arrest for life.\\nMany supporters of Iran continued to fight against the new regime, yet they were suppressed with some even being killed. The political party that Mosaddegh founded, the National Front of Iran, was later reorganized by Karim Sanjabi, and is currently being led by the National Poet of Iran Adib Boroumand, who was a strong Mosaddegh supporter and helped spread pro-Mosaddegh propaganda during the Abadan Crisis and its aftermath.The Communist Tudeh bore the main brunt of the crackdown.:\\u200a84\\u200a The Shah\\'s security forces arrested 4,121 Tudeh political activists including 386 civil servants, 201 college students, 165 teachers, 125 skilled workers, 80 textile workers, and 60 cobblers.:\\u200a89,\\u200a90\\u200a Forty were executed (primarily for murder, such as Khosrow Roozbeh), another 14 died under torture and over 200 were sentenced to life imprisonment. The Shah\\'s post-coup dragnet also captured 477 Tudeh members (\"22 colonels, 69 majors, 100 captains, 193 lieutenants, 19 noncommissioned officers, and 63 military cadets\") who were in the Iranian armed forces.:\\u200a92\\u200a After their presence was revealed, some National Front supporters complained that this Communist Tudeh military network could have saved Mosaddegh. However, few Tudeh officers commanded powerful field units, especially tank divisions that might have countered the coup. Most of the captured Tudeh officers came from the military academies, police and medical corps.:\\u200a92\\u200a:\\u200a92\\u200a At least eleven of the captured army officers were tortured to death between 1953 and 1958.:\\u200a89,\\u200a90\\u200a\\n\\n\\n==== Creation of a secret police ====\\nAfter the 1953 coup, the Shah\\'s government formed the SAVAK (secret police), many of whose agents were trained in the United States. The SAVAK monitored dissidents and carried out censorship. After the 1971 Siahkal Incident, it was given a \"loose leash\" to torture suspected dissidents with \"brute force\" that, over the years, \"increased dramatically\", and nearly 100 people were executed for political reasons during the last 20 years of the Shah\\'s rule.:\\u200a88,\\u200a105\\u200a After the revolution, SAVAK was officially abolished, but was in reality \"drastically expanded\" into a new organization that killed over 8,000‚Äì12,000 prisoners between 1981 and 1985 alone, and 20,000‚Äì30,000 in total, with one prisoner who served time under both the Shah and the Islamic Republic declaring that \"four months under (Islamic Republic\\'s) warden Asadollah Lajevardi took the toll of four years under SAVAK\".\\n\\n\\n==== Oil policy ====\\nAnother effect was sharp improvement of Iran\\'s economy; the British-led oil embargo against Iran ended, and oil revenue increased significantly beyond the pre-nationalisation level. Despite Iran not controlling its national oil, the Shah agreed to replacing the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company with a consortium‚ÄîBritish Petroleum and eight European and American oil companies; in result, oil revenues increased from $34 million in 1954‚Äì1955 to $181 million in 1956‚Äì1957, and continued increasing,:\\u200a419,\\u200a420\\u200a and the United States sent development aid and advisers. The Shah\\'s government attempted to solve the issue of oil nationalization through this method, and Iran began to develop rapidly under his rule. The Shah later in his memoirs declared that Mosaddegh was a \"dictator\" who was \"damaging\" Iran through his \"stubbornness\", while he (the Shah) \"followed\" the smarter option. By the 1970s, Iran was wealthier than all of its surrounding neighbors, and economists frequently predicted that it would become a major global economic power, and a developed country.When the Shah attempted during the 1970s to once again control the oil prices (through OPEC), and cancel the same oil consortium agreement that caused the 1953 coup, it resulted in a massive decline in US support for the Shah, and ironically, hastened his downfall.CIA staff historian David Robarge stated: \"The CIA carried out [a] successful regime change operation. It also transformed a turbulent constitutional monarchy into an absolutist kingship and induced a succession of unintended consequences.\" The 1979 Iranian Revolution was a most impactful unintended consequence.\\n\\n\\n=== Internationally ===\\nKinzer wrote that the 1953 coup d\\'√©tat was the first time the United States used the CIA to overthrow a democratically elected, civil government. The Eisenhower administration viewed Operation Ajax as a success, with \"immediate and far-reaching effect. Overnight, the CIA became a central part of the American foreign policy apparatus, and covert action came to be regarded as a cheap and effective way to shape the course of world events\"‚Äîa coup engineered by the CIA called Operation PBSuccess toppling the duly elected Guatemalan government of Jacobo Arbenz Guzm√°n, which had nationalised farm land owned by the United Fruit Company, followed the next year.:\\u200a209\\u200aA pro-American government in Iran extended the United States\\' geographic and strategic advantage in the Middle East, as Turkey, also bordering the USSR, was part of NATO.In 2000, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, acknowledged the coup\\'s pivotal role in the troubled relationship and \"came closer to apologizing than any American official ever has before\":\\n\\nThe Eisenhower administration believed its actions were justified for strategic reasons. ... But the coup was clearly a setback for Iran\\'s political development. And it is easy to see now why many Iranians continue to resent this intervention by America in their internal affairs.\\nIn June 2009, the U.S. President Barack Obama in a speech in Cairo, Egypt, talked about the United States\\' relationship with Iran, mentioning the role of the U.S. in 1953 Iranian coup saying:\\n\\nThis issue has been a source of tension between the United States and the Islamic Republic of Iran. For many years, Iran has defined itself in part by its opposition to my country, and there is indeed a tumultuous history between us. In the middle of the Cold War, the United States played a role in the overthrow of a democratically elected Iranian government. Since the Islamic Revolution, Iran has played a role in acts of hostage-taking and violence against U.S. troops and civilians. This history is well known. Rather than remain trapped in the past, I have made it clear to Iran\\'s leaders and people that my country is prepared to move forward.\\n\\n\\n== Legacy ==\\nIn the Islamic Republic, remembrance of the coup is quite different from that of history books published in the West, and follows the precepts of Ayatollah Khomeini that Islamic jurists must guide the country to prevent \"the influence of foreign powers\". Kashani came out against Mosaddegh by mid-1953 and \"told a foreign correspondent that Mosaddegh had fallen because he had forgotten that the shah enjoyed extensive popular support.\" A month later, Kashani \"went even further and declared that Mosaddegh deserved to be executed because he had committed the ultimate offense: rebelling against the shah, \\'betraying\\' the country, and repeatedly violating the sacred law.\"Men associated with Mosaddegh and his ideals dominated Iran\\'s first post-revolutionary government. The first prime minister after the Iranian revolution was Mehdi Bazargan, a close associate of Mosaddegh. But with the subsequent rift between the conservative Islamic establishment and the secular liberal forces, Mosaddegh\\'s work and legacy has been largely ignored by the Islamic Republic establishment.:\\u200a258\\u200a However, Mosaddegh remains a popular historical figure among Iranian opposition factions. Mosaddegh\\'s image is one of the symbols of Iran\\'s opposition movement, also known as the Green Movement. Kinzer writes that Mosaddegh \"for most Iranians\" is \"the most vivid symbol of Iran\\'s long struggle for democracy\" and that modern protesters carrying a picture of Mosaddegh is the equivalent of saying \"We want democracy\" and \"No foreign intervention\".\\nIn the Islamic Republic of Iran, Kinzer\\'s book All the Shah\\'s Men: An American Coup and the Roots of Middle East Terror has been censored of descriptions of Ayatollah Abol-Ghasem Kashani\\'s activities during the Anglo-American coup d\\'√©tat. Mahmood Kashani, the son of Abol-Ghasem Kashani, \"one of the top members of the current, ruling √©lite\" whom the Iranian Council of Guardians has twice approved to run for the presidency, denies there was a coup d\\'√©tat in 1953, saying Mosaddegh was obeying British plans to undermine the role of Shia clerics.This allegation also is posited in the book Khaterat-e Arteshbod-e Baznesheshteh Hossein Fardoust (The Memoirs of Retired General Hossein Fardoust), published in the Islamic Republic and allegedly written by Hossein Fardoust, a former SAVAK officer. It says that rather than being a mortal enemy of the British, Mohammad Mosaddegh always favored them, and his nationalisation campaign of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company was inspired by \"the British themselves\". Scholar Ervand Abrahamian suggests that the fact that Fardoust\\'s death was announced before publication of the book may be significant, as the Islamic Republic authorities may have forced him into writing such statements under duress.:\\u200a160,\\u200a161\\u200a\\n\\n\\n== Viewpoints ==\\nRuhollah Khomeini said the government did not pay enough attention to religious figures which caused the coup d\\'√©tat to take place and described the separation between religion and politics as a fault in contemporary history.Ali Khamenei believed that Mosaddegh trusted the United States and asked them to help confront Britain. As a result, the 1953 coup d\\'√©tat was executed by the U.S. against Mosaddegh.President Barack Obama of the United States, said in regard to the role of the U.S. in the 1953 Iranian coup d\\'√©tat that the U.S. played a major role in the overthrow of a democratically elected prime minister.\\n\\n\\n== In popular culture ==\\nDirected by Hasan Fathi and written jointly with playwright and university professor Naghmeh Samini, the TV series Shahrzad is the story of a love broken apart by events in the aftermath of the 1953 coup that overthrew the democratically elected prime minister, Mohammad Mosaddegh.\\nCognito Comics/Verso Books has published a nonfiction graphic novel of the history,   Operation AJAX: The Story of the CIA Coup That Remade The Middle East, that covers events leading to how the CIA hired rival mobs to create chaos and overthrow the country.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== Bibliography ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\n\\nGasiorowski, Mark J.

        " Certainly. The 1953 Iranian coup d'√©tat was rife with cloak-and-dagger maneuvers, intelligence ploys, and clandestine operations. Here are some of the most notable stories and instances that reveal the intricacies of how the coup was orchestrated:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Kermit Roosevelt Jr. in Disguise**: As the CIA's lead agent on the ground, Roosevelt operated undercover, often in disguise. On one occasion, he posed as a German archaeologist. Throughout the operation, Roosevelt was instrumental in distributing funds to stir up anti-Mosaddegh sentiment and organizing pro-Shah protests. His ability to move incognito and rally influential figures against Mosaddegh was pivotal to the coup's success.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Operation Ajax & The BBC Broadcast**: The BBC's Persian radio service began its broadcast with the line \"it is now midday in London\", which was a prearranged signal to launch the coup. This is a testament to how deeply integrated foreign involvement was, co-opting even international media outlets.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Stirring Religious Sentiments**: Roosevelt and his agents successfully employed psychological warfare. They spread false reports and rumors suggesting that Mosaddegh was going to abolish the Muslim call to prayer and implement a secular republic, stirring conservative religious figures against him.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Fake Communist Uprising**: One of the most audacious ploys was creating the perception of a communist threat. CIA agents funded and orchestrated faux Tudeh (communist) party protests, thereby legitimizing the narrative that Mosaddegh was leading Iran into the Soviet fold. This tactic was aimed at convincing the Iranian public and the world that Mosaddegh was a dangerous communist or at least someone who couldn't prevent a communist takeover.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Bribes and Newspapers**: A substantial portion of the CIA's budget for Operation Ajax was used for bribes. They bought off Iranian journalists, newspaper editors, and other influential figures. These media figures played their part by publishing anti-Mosaddegh propaganda, painting him as a communist, a Jew, or as someone betraying Iran.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Mobilizing the Street**: Using the funds, agents on the ground paid gangsters and thugs to create chaos, including destroying religious statues and blaming it on Mosaddegh, further agitating religious conservatives. Roosevelt himself described how he led a crowd toward Parliament, giving a signal to start the riot, leading to full-blown chaos that would later be used as a justification for Mosaddegh's removal.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **The Failed First Attempt**: Before the successful coup, there was a botched attempt. General Fazlollah Zahedi, handpicked by the CIA and MI6 as Mosaddegh's replacement, tried to execute the coup, but Mosaddegh got wind of it. The Shah fled to Italy thinking all was lost. Roosevelt, however, decided to stay and, in a few intense days, turned the situation around, leveraging the networks they had built.\n",
        "\n",
        "These episodes from the 1953 coup shed light on the depths of subterfuge, intelligence trickery, and the influence of covert operations in reshaping nations' destinies. The orchestration of the coup was not merely a political maneuver but involved manipulating public perception, media narratives, and religious sentiments.\n",

            "Morris: Welcome back to another episode of \"Hidden Histories,\" where we delve into the secrets and intrigues that have shaped our world. Today, we have a fascinating story to share ‚Äì the 1953 Iranian coup d'√©tat. Joining me is Chris, a former director at the CIA and an expert on covert operations. Chris, thank you for being here.\n",
            "\n",
            "Chris: It's my pleasure, Morris. This is one of the most captivating stories of espionage and geopolitics, and I'm excited to share it with your listeners.\n",
            "\n",
            "Morris: Let's set the stage, Chris. What was the geopolitical context and background that led to the tensions in Iran during that time?\n",
            "\n",
            "Chris: Morris, Iran found itself caught between two advancing imperial powers, Russia and Britain, in the 19th century. By the early 20th century, Britain had a strong influence on Iran with the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company controlling the country's oil industry. But in 1951, Iran's Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh sought to nationalize the oil industry, which didn't sit well with Britain and the West. And, of course, the Cold War was also a backdrop, with the U.S. fearing a communist takeover and wanting to prevent Soviet influence in the region.\n",
            "\n",
            "Morris: So, tensions were brewing due to Iran's desire to control its own oil resources. Can you tell us more about the specific tensions prevailing at that time?\n",
            "\n",
            "Chris: Absolutely, Morris. The tensions largely revolved around the control and nationalization of Iran's oil industry. Mosaddegh's move to nationalize the oil industry threatened British interests and control over Iranian oil resources. Britain responded with an economic boycott that worsened the economic situation in Iran. This led to popular discontent, loss of support for Mosaddegh, and a perfect storm of opposition fueled by fears of communism and Soviet influence.\n",
            "\n",
            "Morris: It sounds like there were multiple motivations for the coup. Can you elaborate on what drove the U.S. and Britain to orchestrate such an operation?\n",
            "\n",
            "Chris: Certainly. The U.S. and Britain had a lot at stake in Iran's oil industry and didn't want to see it fall into Iranian hands or under Soviet influence. They feared a communist takeover and believed Mosaddegh's government was ineffective in countering Soviet expansionism. Additionally, Iran was strategically located between the Soviet Union and the Persian Gulf oil fields, and stability in the region was of utmost importance to the U.S.\n",
            "\n",
            "Morris: Fascinating. Now, let's talk about the planning and execution of the coup. Who were the key players involved from both sides?\n",
            "\n",
            "Chris: The British intelligence officials played a significant role in initiating and planning the coup, leveraging their experience and ties in the region. On the U.S. side, CIA director Allen Dulles and CIA officer Kermit Roosevelt Jr., who was the grandson of President Theodore Roosevelt, were instrumental in planning and executing the operation. Mohammad Mosaddegh, the democratically elected Prime Minister of Iran, and Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi were the central figures from the Iranian side.\n",
            "\n",
            "Morris: Walk us through the chronology of events leading up to and during the coup.\n",
            "\n",
            "Chris: Mosaddegh rose to power and made his intentions clear of nationalizing the oil industry. British boycott of Iranian oil and economic pressure mounted, worsening the situation in the country. Tensions between Mosaddegh and the Shah grew, as the latter leaned more towards the U.S. and Britain. Ultimately, the coup was planned and executed, leading to the suppression of opposition and the arrest of Mosaddegh.\n",
            "\n",
            "Morris: I've heard some classified tidbits and interesting anecdotes about the coup. Care to share a few?\n",
            "\n",
            "Chris: Certainly, Morris. The CIA used mobsters to stage pro-shah riots, creating a sense of chaos, and paid individuals to flood the streets of Tehran during the coup, causing confusion and distraction. Mosaddegh's subsequent arrest, trial, and conviction of treason made headlines. Furthermore, it's worth noting the Shah's heavy reliance on U.S. support to solidify his power after the coup.\n",
            "\n",
            "Morris: Intriguing indeed. Now, I'd love to hear an in-depth account of one aspect of the coup. Could you share details about the role of the clergy, specifically Ayatollah Abol-Qasem Kashani, in contributing to Mosaddegh's downfall?\n",
            "\n",
            "Chris: Absolutely, Morris. Ayatollah Kashani, a powerful figure in the Shia clergy, organized protests against Mosaddegh and fueled anti-government sentiments among the people. His influence, alongside the support of other religious figures, played a crucial role in swaying public opinion against Mosaddegh and contributed significantly to his downfall.\n",
            "\n",
            "Morris: Thank you for that insight, Chris. Now, let's discuss the aftermath and the long-term implications of the coup.\n",
            "\n",
            "Chris: The coup resulted in the overthrow of Mosaddegh's government and strengthened the monarchy under Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. However, the Shah's rule was marked by authoritarianism and suppression of dissent, leading to growing opposition and ultimately the Iranian Revolution in 1979. The coup caused lasting damage to the U.S. reputation and contributed to anti-American sentiment in Iran. Questions of sovereignty and democracy were raised, and the coup played a significant role in shaping Iran's political landscape for years to come.\n",
            "\n",
            "Morris: And those predicaments and retrospective reflections still resonate today. Thank you for providing us with a riveting account of the 1953 Iranian coup d'√©tat, Chris. Your insights have truly shed light on an often-overlooked chapter of history.\n",
            "\n",
            "Chris: It was my pleasure, Morris. This is a part of history that deserves attention, and I'm glad to have had the opportunity to share it with your listeners.\n",
            "\n",
            "Morris: And there you have it, folks ‚Äì a glimpse into the covert operations that have shaped our world. Join us again next time as we uncover more hidden histories. Until then, stay curious and keep exploring the past. Goodbye!\n",
